 The story begins with the homecoming of Mr. Angeles who came from Mariveles. He wrote a letter for his family about the real weaver artist who make marvelous mats. Apparently, he would bring home his family some mats from this mat weaver.
 Knowing that the rest of the family members will receive their own personalized sleeping mats, they became excited about the news. It was not just an ordinary mat that they would receive but a personalized mat with their names and a color depending on their birthstone. The kids felt so much joy when they heard the news. Giving gifts is part of their tradition when some come back home. This shows how much Mr. Angeles love his family.
 The mat plays an important role to Emelia and Mr. Angeles, for Emelia received a mat by her mother when she got married to Mr. Angeles. 
 Finally, Mr. Angeles arrived, and the kids were excited to receive their personalized sleeping mats. He distributed the mats to his children as he calls the names that is on the mat. Now they were all done, Mr. Angeles’ smile suddenly changed into a frown when he saw that there are three mats left. He could not even look up and mention the names on the mat. He was hesitant to open the three mats left because those are intended for their kids who passed away. He could not get rid of his sadness; still affected about what happened to his children. The issue was very sensitive, and he was so emotional talking about not to forget them. This only show that even though they are dead, they remain in the heart of their father. The sleeping mats used as an outlet to pay as a tribute to his three kids who were not with them anymore.
 The story taught us that we should not forget our loved ones no matter how many years had passed.

For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. in urban areas today,grandparents form a vital part of the primary caregiving network.they are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home,especially so when one or both parents work abroad.Grandparents who aremore affluent enjoy spoiling their grandchildren,giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates grandparents day today it is an appropriate time for young filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents.No two families are alike,but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. make today a special day for grandma and grandpa.grandparents day is a good day for celebration the hands of love that nourish life.write your answer on a sheet of paper.INTRODUCTIONBODYCONCLUSION​</a>

 The story begins with the homecoming of Mr. Angeles who came from Mariveles. He wrote a letter for his family about the real weaver artist who make marvelous mats. Apparently, he would bring home his family some mats from this mat weaver.
 Knowing that the rest of the family members will receive their own personalized sleeping mats, they became excited about the news.

Giving gifts is part of their tradition when some come back home. This shows how much Mr. Angeles love his family.
 The mat plays an important role to Emelia and Mr. Angeles, for Emelia received a mat by her mother when she got married to Mr. Angeles. 
 Finally, Mr. Angeles arrived, and the kids were excited to receive their personalized sleeping mats. He distributed the mats to his children as he calls the names that is on the mat. Now they were all done, Mr. Angeles’ smile suddenly changed into a frown when he saw that there are three mats left. He could not even look up and mention the names on the mat. He was hesitant to open the three mats left because those are intended for their kids who passed away. He could not get rid of his sadness; still affected about what happened to his children. The issue was very sensitive, and he was so emotional talking about not to forget them. This only show that even though they are dead, they remain in the heart of their father. The sleeping mats used as an outlet to pay as a tribute to his three kids who were not with them anymore.
 The story taught us that we should not forget our loved ones no matter how many years had passed.

Even from their early years, children learn the proper ways to show respect for their elders. For example, children quickly learn to ask for the blessing of Lolo and Lola upon arriving home from school. This is most evident in rural areas and among tribal communities, because two or three generations often share the same extended family home. Grandparents play an important role in handling cultural wisdom and values that form part of social glue that hold society together. in urban areas today,grandparents form a vital part of the primary caregiving network.they are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home,especially so when one or both parents work abroad.Grandparents who aremore affluent enjoy spoiling their grandchildren,giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit.

Page 4 In urban areas today, grandparents form a vital part of the primary care giving network. They are the ones who watch over their grandchildren when both parents work and must leave home, especially so when one or both parents work abroad. Grandparents who are more affluent enjoy "spoiling" their grandchildren, giving gifts or preparing special food when they come to visit. As the nation celebrates Grandparent's Day today, it is an appropriate time for young Filipinos to ponder the dept that they owe their grandparents. No two families are alike, but everyone blessed with their grandparents should be able to recognize that he owes a great deal to them. Make today a special day for Grandma and Grandpa.
