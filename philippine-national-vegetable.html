tender. Add the vegetables and season to taste.
4. Once there was a king who unfortunately made the land he ruled the worst
place on Earth. The people cried everyday in misery. The dead, both from
natural and human-made causes, ceaselessly piled up. One day, a beautiful
creature descended from the heavens to relieve the people from the control
of the rotten monarch. The king mysteriously expired and the whole kingdom
was freed at last.
5. It was a most wonderful gift. The wrapping itself was already pretty and
festive. The box emitted a sweet scent when opened. The red cotton-like
material that protected the gift was so relaxing to the hand. The gift, a jar of
the finest porcelain, was something no one had seen in everyday modern life.</a>

                        <strong>Typhoon</strong><p>A "<strong>typhoon</strong>" is a weather feature that is similar to a "cyclone" or a "hurricane." Typhoons are intense low-pressure weather systems that form in the northwest Pacific.</p><br />Here are the answers to the following questions:<p>24. Which is NOT a factor in the formation of a typhoon?</p><p><strong>Answer: C. warm ocean water</strong></p>Typhoons develop from tropical thunderstorms. Strong winds draw moisture from the oceans which means it has <strong>high humidity</strong>. So <strong>letter a: high humidity </strong>is one of the factors in the formation of a typhoon. The moisture in the air is converted into heat by thunderstorms. Because of the heat, more air flows to the center of the storm, causing evaporation. Thus, giving <strong>warm river water</strong>. This is still one of the factors. The typhoon is formed when all of the heat and airflow <strong>toward the eye </strong>so <strong>letter d: optimal location of the typhoon </strong>is still not the answer because it's one of the factors in the formation of a typhoon.<p></p><p>25. Where do typhoons that hit the Philippines mostly originate?</p><p><strong>Answer: A. Pacific Ocean</strong></p>It is due to the Philippines' geographical location. Typhoons typically form in warm water, such as the <strong>Pacific Ocean</strong>. Most typhoons will approach the Philippines from the Pacific Ocean to the east.<p></p><p>26. Which set of weather conditions characterizes the eye of a typhoon?</p><p><strong>Answer: 26. C. light winds, large clouds, heavy rains, and low temperatures</strong></p>As the <strong>typhoon's eye</strong> approaches, the weather will deteriorate rapidly, with winds increasing to their strongest from the north. The weather will suddenly improve with light winds, indicating that the area is under the eye of the typhoon.<p></p><p>27. Which statement does NOT describe the windward side of a mountain?</p><p><strong>Answer: 27. D. It has less vegetation because the moist in the air is accumulated in the leeward side.</strong></p>The <strong>windward </strong>side is exposed to the wind and typically receives warm, moist air from the ocean. The wind is forced upward and begins to cool when it hits a mountain.<p></p><p>28. Which agency takes charge of giving information about incoming typhoons?</p><p><strong>Answer: D. Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)​</strong></p>Using advances in technology, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration or <strong>PAG-ASA </strong>provide adequate, up-to-date data and timely information on atmospheric, astronomical, and other weather-related phenomena.<p></p><p>Learn more about<strong> typhoons</strong> by reading more through the links provided below:</p><p><strong>Center of the typhoon:</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/24475974<br /><strong>A philippine government that supports science:</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/2356113<br /></p><strong>#BrainlyEveryday</strong><br />
