                                            alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure.

                                            Investigation You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report. will be rated using the scoring rubric. Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 2. Write a hypothesis in a testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster. O 3. Identify the variable that you need to control to have a fair test. 4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask from your teacher. 6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them. Write everything that you observed during the dissolving test.​</a>

1. You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected, and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report will be rated using the scoring rubric.
 Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 
2. Write a hypothesis in testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster.
 3. Identify the variable that you need to control in order to have a fair test. 
4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask your teacher. 
6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them. Write everything that you observed during the dissolving test.</a>

1. ➪The soil move faster/fastest to solid. Because molecules in solids are often packed close together unlike liquid and gas.
2. ➪Solids,Solids is medium for plant growth also medium for the filtration of water on its way to the groundwater aquifer comprised of crushed rock, air, water, plant matter, and organisms.
3. ➪The water inside the beaker is decreasing while tiny droplets of water can be seen under the watch glass.
4. ➪The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective absorption and scattering of white light.
5. ➪Any such activity that removes stabilizing vegetation will result in soil erosion.Both soil erosion by wind blowing and deflation and soil erosion by water sheetwash and gullying is to be expected if the protection of stabilizing vegetation is removed and these soils are exposed.

                            10. alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thank you for the summary of the movie "200 Pounds Beauty". Based on the narrative and ending of the movie, the kind of beauty that is prescribed or supported by the film is physical beauty. The movie portrays physical beauty as a means of gaining acceptance and success in society, as the main character's transformation leads to her achieving her dreams and winning the affection of her crush. The movie also suggests that plastic surgery is a viable solution for individuals who are not considered physically attractive, as it can provide a way to change one's appearance and gain confidence. However, it is important to note that the movie does not promote or support the idea of using plastic surgery to conform to societal standards of beauty or to meet others' expectations. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of self-love and acceptance, and the need to focus on inner qualities rather than just physical appearance.</p><br />

                            24. PA HELP PO PLS--
1. You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected, and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report will be rated using the scoring rubric.
 Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 
2. Write a hypothesis in testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster.
 3. Identify the variable that you need to control in order to have a fair test. 
4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5. List all the materials you need, including the amount. You may ask your teacher. 
6. Be sure to record all your observations and tabulate them. Write everything that you observed during the dissolving test.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Size of the particles -- When a solute dissolves, the action takes place only at the surface of each particle. When the total surface area of the solute particles is increased, the solute dissolves more rapidly. Breaking a solute into smaller pieces increases its surface area and increases its rate of solution.</p><br />

                            27. Learning Task No. 2: Application of Heat
In this activity, you will investigate what will happen to materials when
they are heated. You will need the following materials as follows:
matchstick
pot holder
1 pc candle (if not available, use a crayon or both)
1 pc spoon
Note: Conduct an experiment in the kitchen or in an available place that
is safe to keep the experimental set up, clean, safe and manageable
space. Be careful in lighting a matchstick and hot objects. Seek help from
elder member of the family to set up this experiment. This will create
bonding between you and elder member of the family.)
1. Observe the properties of the samples before heating.
2. Crush the materials (candle and/or crayons) and put it in a spoon.
3. Using a match stick, light the candle and heat the spoon containing
the crushed materials. (Use pot holder to hold the spoon while heating).
4. Observe what happens to the lighted candle.
5. Put off the lighted candle carefully by blowing air on it.
6. Let the heated material (s) stand for 2-3 minutes.
7. What happened to the heated materials when they cooled off?
8. Write your observations in the table below.

                            28. Individual Scientific Investigation You are going to investigate how the size of the solid being dissolved affects how fast it dissolves in water. Using the Scientific Method as a guide, you should design a simple experiment and record your results. Be sure to complete each step of the scientific method in order. You should submit a written or typed report to be graded. Remember that you should have stated in your conclusions whether the hypothesis was accepted or rejected and have provided suggestions for further experimentation. The written report will be rated using the scoring rubric. Procedure 1. Obtain the two materials and examine them closely: granules of table salt (uncrushed) and crushed table salt. 2. Write a hypothesis in a testable form. Describe a test you could conduct to find out which of the two materials dissolves faster. O 3. Identify the variable that you need to control to have a fair test. 4. Identify the independent (manipulated/cause) and dependent (responding/effect) 5.

Learning Task 1. Prepare the materials listed below. If not available, you may use other materials at home to perform the activity. You may ask the help of your parents/guardians or any adult members of the family if . Title: Erosion By Water Materials: 2 small pans 6 cups of garden soll 2 bottles of 500 ml water Procedures: 1. Get 2 small pans and fill them with garden soil. Label one pan as A and the other as B. 2. Pour water gradually in the soil on the first pan. What happened to the soll? Describe the movement of the soil. 3. Repeat procedure number 2 on the second pan. This time pour the water rapidly into the soil. What happened? Compare the difference in terms of the movement of the soil from the first one. 4. Record the time and measure your observations. Questions: 1. Based on your observation, in which setup did the soil move faster? Why? 2. Based on your observation, in which setup did the soil move farther? Why? 3. Based on your observation, which setup moved more soil? Why? 4. As you observed, what happened to the color of the water? 5. Based on the data collected in the experiment, what can you conclude about soil erosion?​

1. ➪The soil move faster/fastest to solid. Because molecules in solids are often packed close together unlike liquid and gas.
2. ➪Solids,Solids is medium for plant growth also medium for the filtration of water on its way to the groundwater aquifer comprised of crushed rock, air, water, plant matter, and organisms.
3. ➪The water inside the beaker is decreasing while tiny droplets of water can be seen under the watch glass.
4. ➪The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by selective absorption and scattering of white light.
5. ➪Any such activity that removes stabilizing vegetation will result in soil erosion.Both soil erosion by wind blowing and deflation and soil erosion by water sheetwash and gullying is to be expected if the protection of stabilizing vegetation is removed and these soils are exposed.
