Hearing this news, David instructs the prophet Nathan to anoint David’s son, Solomon, as king. The people rally behind Solomon in a grand procession to the royal throne. Before dying, David charges Solomon to remain faithful to God and his laws. Solomon solidifies his claim to the throne by killing Joab, Adonijah, and the remaining dissenters from David’s reign. He also makes an alliance with Egypt by marrying the pharaoh’s daughter.Because Solomon carefully obeys God’s laws, God appears to him in a dream and offers to grant the new king one wish. Solomon asks for wisdom to govern with justice and to know the difference between right and wrong. God is so impressed with Solomon’s humble request that he promises Solomon the additional gifts of wealth and long life. As a result, Solomon lives in great opulence and his empire stretches from Egypt to the Euphrates River. He earns international fame for his wise sayings and scientific knowledge.Tracker dslogo Full text: DraculaWith his vast resources, Solomon builds an elaborate temple to God as well as a palace for himself in Jerusalem. Construction begins exactly four hundred and eighty years after Israel’s exodus from Egypt. Solomon conscripts thousands of laborers for the work and imports materials from neighboring countries. The Temple is lined with gold and features large, hand-sculpted angels and pillars. Solomon places the Ark of the Covenant inside, and all of Israel gathers for the dedication. After sacrificing herds of animals on the altar, Solomon prays for God’s blessing on the Temple. God appears to Solomon and promises to dwell in the Temple so long as Solomon and the Israelites are obedient to his laws. If they are not, God will remove his presence from the Temple, destroying both the temple and the nation.Solomon’s success continues until he marries many foreign women. They influence him to worship and erect altars to foreign deities. God is infuriated and tells Solomon that he will dismember the kingdom. God will tear away all of the tribes from Solomon’s kingdom except for one, Judah. God allows the tribe of Judah to remain since Solomon is David’s son. Following God’s declaration, a prophet meets one of Solomon’s officials, Jeroboam, with a cloak torn into twelve pieces, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The prophet hands Jeroboam ten of the twelve pieces and explains that God has chosen him to rule these selected tribes as Israel’s new king.Solomon dies, and his son Rehoboam assumes the throne. Led by Jeroboam, the people gather before the young king to request that Rehoboam treat them more kindly than Solomon did during his reign. Rehoboam is headstrong and refuses, threatening to punish and enslave the people. The Israelites unite in rebellion, cursing the tribe of Judah and eluding Rehoboam’s attempts to forcefully subdue them. They head north, where they crown Jeroboam king of Israel in the city of Shechem. Israel splits into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel in the north, and the kingdom of Judah in the south.To distinguish the new, separate kingdom of Israel from the old kingdom in Jerusalem, Jeroboam erects altars and shrines to golden calves throughout the northern land. The Israelites worship the idols, and the Levite priests, formerly devoted to God, serve them as well. One day, Jeroboam’s son is ill, and his wife approaches a prophet to seek guidance. The prophet warns that Jeroboam’s household will be destroyed and that Israel will eventually lose control of the promised land because of Jeroboam’s abhorrent practices. One generation later, Jeroboam’s entire family is slaughtered when another Israelite takes the throne by force.​</a>

Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

                                            V. Read the "Parable of theroa"Parable of the Prodigal Son"The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of theestate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his Inheritance, he wanted it immediately. Thefather agrees and divides his estate between both sons.Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money inextravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a famine strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take workas a swineherd. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.)When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses. And when he cameto himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I willarise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no moreworthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he wasyet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. This implies thefather was hopefully watching for the son's return. The son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech, before hisfather accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitation as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, aring, and sandals, and slaughter the "fatted calf" for a celebratory meal. The older son, who was at work in the fields, hearsthe sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. Healso has a speech for his father. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neithertransgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. Thefather explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary. It wasmeet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.​</a>

                            4. can someone summarize this in speedwrite please David is old and bed-ridden, and his son Adonijah proclaims himself king with the help of David’s commander Joab and the priest, Abiathar. Hearing this news, David instructs the prophet Nathan to anoint David’s son, Solomon, as king. The people rally behind Solomon in a grand procession to the royal throne. Before dying, David charges Solomon to remain faithful to God and his laws. Solomon solidifies his claim to the throne by killing Joab, Adonijah, and the remaining dissenters from David’s reign. He also makes an alliance with Egypt by marrying the pharaoh’s daughter.Because Solomon carefully obeys God’s laws, God appears to him in a dream and offers to grant the new king one wish. Solomon asks for wisdom to govern with justice and to know the difference between right and wrong. God is so impressed with Solomon’s humble request that he promises Solomon the additional gifts of wealth and long life. As a result, Solomon lives in great opulence and his empire stretches from Egypt to the Euphrates River. He earns international fame for his wise sayings and scientific knowledge.Tracker dslogo Full text: DraculaWith his vast resources, Solomon builds an elaborate temple to God as well as a palace for himself in Jerusalem. Construction begins exactly four hundred and eighty years after Israel’s exodus from Egypt. Solomon conscripts thousands of laborers for the work and imports materials from neighboring countries. The Temple is lined with gold and features large, hand-sculpted angels and pillars. Solomon places the Ark of the Covenant inside, and all of Israel gathers for the dedication. After sacrificing herds of animals on the altar, Solomon prays for God’s blessing on the Temple. God appears to Solomon and promises to dwell in the Temple so long as Solomon and the Israelites are obedient to his laws. If they are not, God will remove his presence from the Temple, destroying both the temple and the nation.Solomon’s success continues until he marries many foreign women. They influence him to worship and erect altars to foreign deities. God is infuriated and tells Solomon that he will dismember the kingdom. God will tear away all of the tribes from Solomon’s kingdom except for one, Judah. God allows the tribe of Judah to remain since Solomon is David’s son. Following God’s declaration, a prophet meets one of Solomon’s officials, Jeroboam, with a cloak torn into twelve pieces, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. The prophet hands Jeroboam ten of the twelve pieces and explains that God has chosen him to rule these selected tribes as Israel’s new king.Solomon dies, and his son Rehoboam assumes the throne. Led by Jeroboam, the people gather before the young king to request that Rehoboam treat them more kindly than Solomon did during his reign. Rehoboam is headstrong and refuses, threatening to punish and enslave the people. The Israelites unite in rebellion, cursing the tribe of Judah and eluding Rehoboam’s attempts to forcefully subdue them. They head north, where they crown Jeroboam king of Israel in the city of Shechem. Israel splits into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel in the north, and the kingdom of Judah in the south.To distinguish the new, separate kingdom of Israel from the old kingdom in Jerusalem, Jeroboam erects altars and shrines to golden calves throughout the northern land. The Israelites worship the idols, and the Levite priests, formerly devoted to God, serve them as well. One day, Jeroboam’s son is ill, and his wife approaches a prophet to seek guidance. The prophet warns that Jeroboam’s household will be destroyed and that Israel will eventually lose control of the promised land because of Jeroboam’s abhorrent practices. One generation later, Jeroboam’s entire family is slaughtered when another Israelite takes the throne by force.​</h2><br />

Afterwards, identify the problems/issues met by the author in his desire to improve his community by listing down the issues in the table provided then put a label what issue is it Sanitary Reform and Famine Relief by: M.K. Gandhi It has always been possible for me to reconcile myself to any one member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been loathe to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to press for its rights without having purged it of its blemishes Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal. I had been endeavoring to clear the community of a charge that had been leveled against it, not without a certain amount of truth The charge had often been made that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had, therefore, already begun to put their house in order, but house-to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining the approval of the city fathers, who had desired our cooperation Our cooperation made work easier for them and at the same time lessened our hardships. For whenever there is an outbreak of epidemics, the executive, as a general rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community saved itself from this oppression by voluntarily taking sanitary measures But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily count on the help of the community in getting it to do its own duty, as I could in claiming for its rights At some places I met with insults, at others with polite indifference. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to keep their surroundings clean Toe expect them to find money for the work was out of the question. These experiences taught me better than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for the reform, and not the society, from which he should expect nothing better than opposition, abhorrence and even moral persecution Why may not society regard as retrogression what the reformers holds dear as life itself? Nevertheless, the result of this agitation was that Indian community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping their house and environments clean I gained the esteem of the authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to ventilate grievances and press rights, I was no less keen and insistent upon self-purification There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done, namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the motherland India was poor the Indian settler went to South Africa in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part off his earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines of 1897 and 1899. They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more so in 1899 than 1897 We had appealed to Englishmen also for funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the time of these families had been continued ever since, and we know that Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contribution to India in times of national calamity Thus, service of the Indians in South Africa ever revealed to me new implications of truth in every stage Truth is like a vast tree, which yields more and more fruit, the more you nurture it. The deeper the search in the mine of truth, he richer the discovery of the gems buried there, in the shape of openings for an ever greater variety of service.

                            16. V. Read the "Parable of theroa"Parable of the Prodigal Son"The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of theestate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his Inheritance, he wanted it immediately. Thefather agrees and divides his estate between both sons.Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country and wastes all his money inextravagant living. Immediately thereafter, a famine strikes the land; he becomes desperately poor and is forced to take workas a swineherd. (This, too, would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals.)When he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is watching, he finally comes to his senses. And when he cameto himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I willarise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no moreworthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he wasyet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. This implies thefather was hopefully watching for the son's return. The son does not even have time to finish his rehearsed speech, before hisfather accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitation as the father calls for his servants to dress him in a fine robe, aring, and sandals, and slaughter the "fatted calf" for a celebratory meal. The older son, who was at work in the fields, hearsthe sound of celebration, and is told about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. Healso has a speech for his father. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neithertransgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. Thefather explaining that because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary. It wasmeet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The content and meaning of childhood disability underwent a revolution'during the nineteenth century. Early in the century, a medical diagnosis of" idiocy" described a child whose apparent" mental deficiency" was presumed to be permanent. By the mid nineteenth century, European physicians proposed that such" arrested development of the will" could be overcome by judicious training in the classroom and gymnasium. Consequently, American reformers established residential schools for idiotic children across the United States, with the goal of making their pupils" happy and useful." By the end of the century, these schools had been transformed into enormous custodial asylums for the" feebleminded," and their medical superintendents became among the most vocal advocates of the eugenics movement.</p><br />
