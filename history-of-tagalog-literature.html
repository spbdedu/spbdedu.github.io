                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
