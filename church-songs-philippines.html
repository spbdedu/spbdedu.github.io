                                            PHILIPPINE LENT Lent in the Philippines, especially the Holy Week, is one of the unique observances in Christiandom. History shows that the initiation of Lent was implanted by the Spanish conquistadores who came to our country in the middle of the 16th century for the dual purpose of extending the limits of the Spanish empire and for spreading the Catholic faith. Our Philippine Lenten customs and rituals consist of the Peniteneiye, Pabasa, Bieita Iglesiya, Senakule, Siyete Palabras, Salubong and Linggo ng Pagkabuhay. Calling themselves as flagellants or penitents, these men and women have vowed to undertake annual flagellation to cleanse themselves of sins against God and fellowmen. Garbed in black, with their faces covered with a mask or thin cloth, these penitents walk around the streets, flogging themselves and uttering prayers. They flog themselves with switches or dried branches of trees. Sometimes, a flagellant has a com- panion who deals him the blows. The second, though not as popular as the first in the Lenten rituals, is the Pabasa. It is the reading of the passion of Christ, done in a sing-song chant, lasting for 24 hours. Holding this Pabasa is supposed to be in connection with a vow a person made either as form of penitence during Holy Week or to give thanks for blessings received or prayers answered. The Bisita Iglesia is observed in which the devotees make trips to various churches to undertake the stations of the Cross. This is usually done on Maundy Thursday or Good Friday. The Senakulo is nothing more than the stage drama- tization of the Pabasa. It focuses on the highlights of the passion and crucifixion of Christ. Not all communities ob- serve this Lenten practice. Amateur or professional actors compose the dramatis personae of this presentation on s stage.​</a>

                            30. PHILIPPINE LENT Lent in the Philippines, especially the Holy Week, is one of the unique observances in Christiandom. History shows that the initiation of Lent was implanted by the Spanish conquistadores who came to our country in the middle of the 16th century for the dual purpose of extending the limits of the Spanish empire and for spreading the Catholic faith. Our Philippine Lenten customs and rituals consist of the Peniteneiye, Pabasa, Bieita Iglesiya, Senakule, Siyete Palabras, Salubong and Linggo ng Pagkabuhay. Calling themselves as flagellants or penitents, these men and women have vowed to undertake annual flagellation to cleanse themselves of sins against God and fellowmen. Garbed in black, with their faces covered with a mask or thin cloth, these penitents walk around the streets, flogging themselves and uttering prayers. They flog themselves with switches or dried branches of trees. Sometimes, a flagellant has a com- panion who deals him the blows. The second, though not as popular as the first in the Lenten rituals, is the Pabasa. It is the reading of the passion of Christ, done in a sing-song chant, lasting for 24 hours. Holding this Pabasa is supposed to be in connection with a vow a person made either as form of penitence during Holy Week or to give thanks for blessings received or prayers answered. The Bisita Iglesia is observed in which the devotees make trips to various churches to undertake the stations of the Cross. This is usually done on Maundy Thursday or Good Friday. The Senakulo is nothing more than the stage drama- tization of the Pabasa. It focuses on the highlights of the passion and crucifixion of Christ. Not all communities ob- serve this Lenten practice. Amateur or professional actors compose the dramatis personae of this presentation on s stage.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Philippine Lent is a unique observance in Christianity that was initiated by Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century. The Lenten customs and rituals include Peniteneiye, Pabasa, Bieita Iglesiya, Senakule, Siyete Palabras, Salubong, and Linggo ng Pagkabuhay. The flagellants or penitents garbed in black, walk around the streets flogging themselves and uttering prayers to cleanse themselves of sins. The Pabasa is the reading of the passion of Christ, done in a sing-song chant, lasting for 24 hours. The Bisita Iglesia is observed, in which the devotees make trips to various churches to undertake the stations of the Cross. These unique Lenten practices provide an opportunity for devotees to reflect and deepen their faith during the Holy Week.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
