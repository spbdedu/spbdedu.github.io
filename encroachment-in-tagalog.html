                                            1) Human encroachment into wildlife forests is said to be one of the major causes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the lack of awareness of citizens on the relationship of microorganisms and wildlife, educational agencies highly suggest the need of re-orientation of citizens in communities regarding its importance. In this study, an interview was conducted in Tacloban City, Leyte to determine the level of awareness of the respondents (n = 1567) regarding the relationship of microorganisms and wildlife. Open-ended questions were used in the questionnaire. Results have shown that only 21.6% of the respondents were aware that a pandemic could have been caused by wildlife disturbance. Moreover, the belief that the COVID-19 pandemic is due to environmental disturbance is significantly higher in respondents from ages 12-18 than respondents within the age range of 18-24. The results of the study suggest establishing a more thorough reinforcement in the information drive of local agencies in informing the citizens on the importance of wildlife flora and fauna on public health. Questions: What is the research question of the study? _______________________________________________________________________ What were the methods used? Was it quantitative or qualitative? _________________________________________________________________________ Based on the text, which respondents believe that the COVID-19 pandemic was caused by environment disturbance? a.) Ages 12-18 	b.) Ages 18-24​</a>

But in a sense, it is more dangerous than thetentacles of an octopus because it is subtle, and therefore, treacherous. When the population is fairly small, itsencroachment may not be noticed at all. Hence, it is not given attention because its presence does not pose a pressingproblem for policymakersA Rapid population growth is more dangerous than the tentacles of an octopusB. The present world of population is fairly small.C. Population grows like an octopus, so it is more dangerousD. Rapid population growth does not pose a pressing problem for policymakers.3.The milk must be refrigerated continuously, in which case it will stay for a few days. This is where asepticpackaging is useful because this process maintains the produce at room temperature with no loss in flavor and quality forseveral weeks. In aseptic packaging, the product passes from the UHT treatment in a closed system to the packagingmachine There, it is packed under aseptic conditions in a sterile packaging material which keeps out both air and light.A. The milk must be refrigerated continuouslyB. Aseptic packaging is useful in storing milk and other productsC. Aseptic packaging is useful because it improves the taste of the milk.D. It is important to pack milk under aseptic conditions in a sterile packaging material4.Breastfeeding contributes to our peso-saving effort since mothers do not have to buy formula milk that is usuallymanufactured by multinationals.

                                            40. In industrialized nations, education typically follows a single life cycle called a cradle - to - grave policy in which major investments are made to educate children to become fully literate adults. But sometimes this doesn't happen, and millions of children grow up to become functionally illiterate adults. Which part of exposition is this?a. Arguments b. Claimc. Statement of Position d.

Nuclear power also protects the natural environment by requiring far less land and resources thanother energy sources - an especially important attribute for the Philippines, a biodiversity hotspot. Dueto the energy density of nuclear fuel, coastal nuclear plants in the Philippines would require 180 timesless land and 17 times less construction material than solar. a. Argumentc.

                                            ACTIVITY 15INSTRUCTIONS: Below is an example essay with the different types of transition signals. Accomplish thefollowing tasks enumerated after the essay.Title: Consider whether Human Activity has made the World a Better Place.History shows that human beings have come a long way from where they started. They have developed new technologies which means that everybody can enjoy luxuries they never previously imagined. However, the technologies that are temporarily making this world a better place to live could well prove to be an ultimate disaster due to, among other things, the creation of nuclear weapons, increasing pollution, and loss of animal species.The biggest threat to the earth caused by modern human activity comes from the creation of nuclear weapons. Although it cannot be denied that countries have to defend themselves, the kind of weapons that some of them currently possess are far in excess of what is needed for defense. If these weapons were used, they could lead to the destruction of the entire planet.Another harm caused by human activity to this earth is pollution. People have become reliant on modern technology, which can have adverse effects on the environment. For example, reliance on cars causes air and noise pollution. Even seemingly innocent devices, such as computers and mobile phones, use electricity, most of which is produced from coal-burning power stations, which further adds to environmental pollution. If we do not curb our direct and indirect use of fossil fuels, the harm to the environment may be catastrophic.Animals are important features of this earth and the past decades have witnessed the extinction of a considerable number of animal species. This is the consequence of human encroachment on wildlife habitats, such as deforestation to expand human cities. Some may argue that such loss of species is natural and has occurred throughout earth's history. However, the current rate of species loss far exceeds normal levels, and is threatening to become a mass extinction event.In summary, there is no doubt that current human activities such as the creation of nuclear weapons, pollution, and destruction of wildlife, are harmful to the earth. It is important for us to see not only the short-term effects of our actions, but their long-term effects as well. Otherwise, human activities will be just another step towards destruction.TASKS:1.

Liporada | SAN DIEGO, 2/3/2012 - While the Sendong mudslide catastrophe which killed thousands of Filipinos is still fresh in our emotional quotient and with the seeming withering away from memory of similar disasters in Bicol and Leyte, Baguio City citizens are up in furor against what they call the impending massacre' of 182 trees by conglomerate ShoeMart (SM). These 182 trees might as well be the hallmark of the fight against denudation in the Philippines which have given way to mining conglomerates, real estate expansions, and commercial encroachment which, unbridled, have proven disastrous to the environment - bringing death and continuing pestilence. The issue on the 182 trees has all the trappings of the conflict drama involving a heartless conglomerate, a castrated Baguio mayor and his City Council, environmental policies which are being railroaded - all against Baguio citizens who are against the 'massacre' of these trees. question: What is the main idea of the text?​</a>

An excerpt from As the Bamboos Sway by Rudy D Liporada I SAN DIEGO, 2/3/2012
-
While the Sendong mudslide catastrophe which killed thousands of Filipinos is still fresh in our
emotional quotient and with the seeming withering away from memory of similar disasters in
Bicol and Leyte, Baguio City citizens are up in furor against what they call the impending
'massacre of 182 treas by conglomerate ShoeMart (SM).
These 182 trees might as well be the hallmark of the fight against denudation in the
Philippines which have given way to mining conglomerates, real estate expansions, and
commercial encroachment which, unbridled, have proven disastrous to the environment
bringing death and continuing pestilence.
The issue on the 182 trees has all the trappings of the conflict drama involving a heartless
conglomerate, a castrated Baguio mayor and his City Council, environmental policies which
are being railroaded all against Baguio citizens who are against the massacre of these
trees.

                            5. 1) Human encroachment into wildlife forests is said to be one of the major causes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the lack of awareness of citizens on the relationship of microorganisms and wildlife, educational agencies highly suggest the need of re-orientation of citizens in communities regarding its importance. In this study, an interview was conducted in Tacloban City, Leyte to determine the level of awareness of the respondents (n = 1567) regarding the relationship of microorganisms and wildlife. Open-ended questions were used in the questionnaire. Results have shown that only 21.6% of the respondents were aware that a pandemic could have been caused by wildlife disturbance. Moreover, the belief that the COVID-19 pandemic is due to environmental disturbance is significantly higher in respondents from ages 12-18 than respondents within the age range of 18-24. The results of the study suggest establishing a more thorough reinforcement in the information drive of local agencies in informing the citizens on the importance of wildlife flora and fauna on public health.

                            13. ACTIVITY 15INSTRUCTIONS: Below is an example essay with the different types of transition signals. Accomplish thefollowing tasks enumerated after the essay.Title: Consider whether Human Activity has made the World a Better Place.History shows that human beings have come a long way from where they started. They have developed new technologies which means that everybody can enjoy luxuries they never previously imagined. However, the technologies that are temporarily making this world a better place to live could well prove to be an ultimate disaster due to, among other things, the creation of nuclear weapons, increasing pollution, and loss of animal species.The biggest threat to the earth caused by modern human activity comes from the creation of nuclear weapons. Although it cannot be denied that countries have to defend themselves, the kind of weapons that some of them currently possess are far in excess of what is needed for defense. If these weapons were used, they could lead to the destruction of the entire planet.Another harm caused by human activity to this earth is pollution. People have become reliant on modern technology, which can have adverse effects on the environment. For example, reliance on cars causes air and noise pollution. Even seemingly innocent devices, such as computers and mobile phones, use electricity, most of which is produced from coal-burning power stations, which further adds to environmental pollution. If we do not curb our direct and indirect use of fossil fuels, the harm to the environment may be catastrophic.Animals are important features of this earth and the past decades have witnessed the extinction of a considerable number of animal species. This is the consequence of human encroachment on wildlife habitats, such as deforestation to expand human cities. Some may argue that such loss of species is natural and has occurred throughout earth's history. However, the current rate of species loss far exceeds normal levels, and is threatening to become a mass extinction event.In summary, there is no doubt that current human activities such as the creation of nuclear weapons, pollution, and destruction of wildlife, are harmful to the earth. It is important for us to see not only the short-term effects of our actions, but their long-term effects as well. Otherwise, human activities will be just another step towards destruction.TASKS:1.

                        <p>Affects on the environment:</p><p></p><p>Pollution: Boracay Island's ecology can be significantly impacted by pollution. Marine life, including coral and fish, can be harmed by water pollution, which can result in a decline in biodiversity. Pollution can also cause harmful algal blooms to form, which can make the environment even worse.</p><p></p><p>High Concentration of Fecal Coliform: High levels of fecal coliform in the water can be a sign of sewage and other contaminants, which can be harmful to humans and wildlife. Additionally, this may result in a decline in ecosystem health and water quality.</p><p></p><p>Destruction of Marine Wildlife/Coral Degradation: Overfishing, contamination, and other human exercises can prompt the obliteration of marine natural life and coral reefs, which can prompt a decrease in biodiversity and biological system wellbeing. Because people come to Boracay Island to see its natural beauty and marine life, this may also have an effect on the tourism sector.</p><p></p><p>Disappearance of Wetlands/Encroachment of Protected Areas: The ecology of Boracay Island can be significantly altered by the loss of protected areas and wetlands. Wetlands give basic environment to numerous types of plants and creatures, while safeguarded regions help to save biodiversity and biological system wellbeing.</p><p></p><p>B. Financial Effects:</p><p></p><p>Pollution: The degradation of the island's natural beauty and marine life by pollution can be detrimental to the tourism industry. The decline in tourism revenue may be caused by tourists choosing to visit other locations with environments that are cleaner and more pristine.</p><p></p><p>Destruction of Marine Wildlife/Coral Degradation: Since people come to Boracay Island to see its natural beauty and marine life, the destruction of coral reefs and marine life can have an effect on the tourism industry. Tourist numbers and revenue can decrease if marine life and coral reefs decline.</p><p></p><p>Disappearance of Wetlands/Encroachment of Protected Areas: The tourism industry may also be affected by the disappearance of protected areas and wetlands. These regions give amazing open doors to ecotourism and outside amusement, which can draw in guests to the island. Tourism revenue may decline as a result of the loss of these areas.</p><p></p><p>C. Effects on society:</p><p></p><p>Pollution: Both island visitors and island residents can suffer health effects from pollution. A variety of health issues, including skin infections, respiratory issues, and gastrointestinal issues, can result from exposure to contaminated water.</p><p></p><p>Destruction of Marine Wildlife/Coral Degradation: The cultural and social identity of Boracay Island may be affected by the destruction of marine life and coral reefs. On the island, fishing is an important cultural and economic activity, and a decline in fish stocks may be detrimental to the livelihoods of the island's fishermen.</p><p></p><p>Disappearance of Wetlands/Encroachment of Protected Areas: The island's cultural and social identity may be affected by the loss of protected areas and wetlands. Many different species of plants and animals depend on these areas for their habitat, which is important to the local communities' spiritual and cultural traditions. The local communities that rely on these areas for their livelihoods may also be affected by their loss.</p><br />

-
While the Sendong mudslide catastrophe which killed thousands of Filipinos is still fresh in our
emotional quotient and with the seeming withering away from memory of similar disasters in
Bicol and Leyte, Baguio City citizens are up in furor against what they call the impending
'massacre of 182 treas by conglomerate ShoeMart (SM).
These 182 trees might as well be the hallmark of the fight against denudation in the
Philippines which have given way to mining conglomerates, real estate expansions, and
commercial encroachment which, unbridled, have proven disastrous to the environment
bringing death and continuing pestilence.
The issue on the 182 trees has all the trappings of the conflict drama involving a heartless
conglomerate, a castrated Baguio mayor and his City Council, environmental policies which
are being railroaded all against Baguio citizens who are against the massacre of these
trees.
