First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible for large loans. Second, banks would bundle this toxic loans and sell themas packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed thesepackages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Pourth,because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housingmarket, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them formore than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. Thesebubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causingemployers to lose capital and lay off employees.

                                            1. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. Answer: Purpose Structure 2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching "NETFLIX" on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate. Answer: Purpose Structure 3.

Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees.

Answer: Purpose Structure 5. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Most people infected with the COVID -19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. This virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when the infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID 19.

First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were highrisk or unworthy of credit or borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible for large loans. Second,banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurancefirms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of theease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth of housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intendingto sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculations. These bubbles burst,sending the whole market into a downward spiral , causing employees to lose capital and lay off employees,Consumer spending then plummeted and most business suffered.

                            9. 1. All things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the identity of the matter. For instance, clay will bend if squeezed. Still it will be a clay. Change in shape is a physical change. It does not change the matter's identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For instance, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash. It will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary. While chemical changes are permanent. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. Answer: Purpose Structure 2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching "NETFLIX" on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate. Answer: Purpose Structure 3.

Many people are confused about why our economy went to shambles in 2008. The crisis was actually the result of a combination of many complex factors. First, easy credit conditions allowed people who were high-risk or unworthy of credit to borrow, and even people who had no income were eligible 15 for large loans. Second, banks would bundle these toxic loans and sell them as packages on the financial market. Third, large insurance firms backed these packages, misrepresenting these high-risk loans as safe investments. Fourth, because of the ease of acquiring credit and the rapid growth in the housing market, people were buying two or three houses, intending to sell them for more than they paid. All of these factors created bubbles of speculation. These bubbles burst, sending the whole market into a downward spiral, causing employers to lose capital and lay off employees. Consumer spending then dropped and most businesses suffered. The economy is like a big boat, and once it gets moving quickly in the wrong direction, it's hard to turn it around. Answer: Purpose Structure 5. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered corona virus. Most people infected with the COVID -19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. This virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when the infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID 19.
