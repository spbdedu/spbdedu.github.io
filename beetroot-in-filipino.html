                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>d. Factual texts are research-based.(guess so:)
</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are two main text types, factual and literary. Within these are many more narrowly defined text types. Factual text types include such types as factual description, recount, or persuasive. Literary text types include such types as poetry, narrative or personal response.
</p><p>There are many aspects to literary writing, and many ways to analyse it, but four basic categories are descriptive, narrative, expository, and argumentative.
