I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, "They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles. At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goats, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.I need Po It now thanks ​</a>

"They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed.help me 1-5 ​</a>

I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate They appeared inghtened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming the guns at people they passed by: hence they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time they did not hurt anybody from Baroy, however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter This drastcally changed the picture of the highway People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestc animals such as goats pigs dogs etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod​</a>

I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, “They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" | nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, “ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's “You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their slout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "Ilaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goals, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta vla rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.​</a>

"They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" I nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, "ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's "You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their stout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "llaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed.help me 1-5 ​</h2><br />

I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate They appeared inghtened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming the guns at people they passed by: hence they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time they did not hurt anybody from Baroy, however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter This drastcally changed the picture of the highway People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestc animals such as goats pigs dogs etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub Ozamiz, and Oroquieta via rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod​</h2><br />

A - First Person B - Second Person C. Third Person Objective D - Third Person Limited E - Third Person Omniscient 1. I sought Tatay's mind about the Baracuda and he said, “They are human beings who opted to become enemies of the country." In my mind, I asked a number of questions including the reasons why some people would love to create trouble. "Why would they not allow others to enjoy a peaceful life?" | nagged myself. Before dinner time, my brother Junior and I developed the habit of going to my Aunt Nanay Mameng's big store, just two blocks away from our house, because people would gather there to buy things they needed at home like rice and corn grits by the ganta, canned goods, “ginamos" (salted anchovies) and dried fish, bread, soft drinks, liquors, slippers, etc. Others went there to while away time by playing music from the Jukebox that released Victor Wood's “You Are My Destiny" or Eddie Perigrina's "What Am I Living For?". 2. There in the store, haggard-looking long-haired bearded men with their slout guns called "pali-untod" (sp?) could be seen gleefully drinking Kulafu or tuba or Fighter Wine. Guests at the store whispered to one another that these drinkers were the famous "Ilaga", men who were believed to be invulnerable due to the amulets and bottled oils that they possessed and the "oracion" (secret prayers) that they recited and the rituals that they performed. 3. While gulping their favorite drinks, people would gather because they would brag about their encounters with the Baracuda in the outskirts of the neighboring towns. They talked about combat tactics, death and victories. There was one thing that struck us most: the dried dark things the men took as hors d'oeuvres, which they claimed as ears and manhood of the enemies they encountered. To my young mind, that was excessively brutal and that scared me to even gaze at them both: the llaga and the Baracuda. 4. One afternoon, after dismissal time in school, I saw Nanay along with a number of parents rushing to meet us children at the school gate. They appeared frightened as they told the teachers that droves of Baracuda in vehicles were aiming their guns at people they passed by; hence, they were afraid the Baracuda would hurt the school children on their way home - the very reason they were fetching them. 5. Every day the Baracuda passed by either marching or riding in dirty-looking vehicles At that time, they did not hurt anybody from Baroy; however, we heard news that the bodyguard of the governor got killed in an encounter. This drastically changed the picture of the highway. People from the remote mountains came down in their karomata (cart pulled by a carabao), filled with hungry-looking crying children, possessions in sacks, while tugging along domestic animals such as goals, pigs, dogs, etc. They were the evacuees who sought immediate refuge across Panguil Bay - to the province of Misamis Occidental and the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz, and Oroquieta vla rented pump boats from the coasts of Baroy and Tubod.​</h2><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>1. Inverse proportion</p><p>2. Direct proportion</p><p>3. Direct proportion</p><p>4. Inverse proportion</p><p>5. Direct proportion</p><p></p><p>Step-by-step explanation:</p><p>In some instances, a change in one quantity means a change also in another quantity. It can be a direct or inverse proportion. In direct proportion, when one quantity increases the other quantity increases, and in the same way, if one quantity decreases, the other quantity also decreases. One example is in buying goods, the more goods we buy, the higher the cost. On the other hand, in inverse proportion, when one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases, and vice versa. For example,  is the speed of the object. As the speed increases, the lesser time it will take to cover a distance. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
