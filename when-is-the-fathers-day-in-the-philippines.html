                                            The Reality of Suicide in the Philippines Written by Gis It ison The Story of Henry Henry used to be a happy person. He used to love what he was a fulfilled man, and he was promoted at an early age, but he found himself in a black hole when his mother died. His wedding was called off a day before it was supposed to happen. The problems seemed insurmountable for Henry to handle, they seemed to be piling up every day. It came to a point when he did not know how to handle or to solve them anymore The thought of sticade most often occurs when a person feels that he has run out of solutions to problems that seem inescapable, intolerably painful, and never-ending. Support seemed remote. Henry was scared to be seen as a wealding which is the exact opposite of the image that he projects to others and withm himself. His mind went blank. He had a packet of sleeping tablets enough to down him for life, got 20, and was ready to pop it all until the thought of his sick father came to mind. When he thought of his father's recurring words of his will to live, he dropped the pills and ran to him for solace. He poured his heart out which was the first time in his life when support seemed to be real.​</a>

                                            My Thai CatBy Pratoomratha ZengA Siamese cat was given by a friend of Zeng's father. Zeng named the cat, Sli Sward.Zeng recalled the time when his cat was elected by the villagers as the Rain Queenbecause of what the cat did during the drought in 1925.There was a time when the villagers were so desperate for rain. So, they performed theold Brahmo-Buddhist rain ceremony called the Nang Maaw, the queen of the cats. Thisceremony had been performed by the peasants since time immemorial. However, nothinghappenedOne day, an old lady visited Zeng's father to ask Sii Sward's help for rain. At first, Zengwas hesitant because he thought that Sii Sward might be killed for an offering. As atradition, to refuse the will or command of the father was a grave sin. Fortunately, his fatherunderstood Zeng's feeling. So, he did not let the Siamese cat die for an offering.Nevertheless, they continued the ceremony. Sii Sward was put inside the cage and wasapplied with perfume. The cat misbehaved but was later calmed down when Zengapproached it. During the ceremony, the cat fell asleep. The villagers offered their chantuntil the Siamese cat fell asleep for three days. Then days went by, rain fell. Since then,Sii Sward was elected as the Rain Queen of their village.haping InterpretationWhat is the story all about?How did Sii Sward become instrumental in praying for rain?Do we have the same practice of worshipping here in the Philippines?How do we Filipinos and Thais regard cats?In what ways are Filipinos similar to or different from the Thais in terms of prayingor worshipping?​</a>

Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.''1.

At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila andbegan my secondary education at San Juan de Letran College. First, I livedin the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for onepriest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father movedme to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded.The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him whocould only use his own feet as a means of transportation. Myclasses started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up veryearly to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and thefollowing year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as anintern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highesthonors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on myeducation. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop mystudies unless I could work my way through university education. I cameto Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, hadbecome very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be alawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for meas one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and boardand free tuition.

His wedding was called off a day before it was supposed to happen. The problems seemed insurmountable for Henry to handle, they seemed to be piling up every day. It came to a point when he did not know how to handle or to solve them anymore The thought of sticade most often occurs when a person feels that he has run out of solutions to problems that seem inescapable, intolerably painful, and never-ending. Support seemed remote. Henry was scared to be seen as a wealding which is the exact opposite of the image that he projects to others and withm himself. His mind went blank. He had a packet of sleeping tablets enough to down him for life, got 20, and was ready to pop it all until the thought of his sick father came to mind. When he thought of his father's recurring words of his will to live, he dropped the pills and ran to him for solace. He poured his heart out which was the first time in his life when support seemed to be real.​</h2><br />

Zeng named the cat, Sli Sward.Zeng recalled the time when his cat was elected by the villagers as the Rain Queenbecause of what the cat did during the drought in 1925.There was a time when the villagers were so desperate for rain. So, they performed theold Brahmo-Buddhist rain ceremony called the Nang Maaw, the queen of the cats. Thisceremony had been performed by the peasants since time immemorial. However, nothinghappenedOne day, an old lady visited Zeng's father to ask Sii Sward's help for rain. At first, Zengwas hesitant because he thought that Sii Sward might be killed for an offering. As atradition, to refuse the will or command of the father was a grave sin. Fortunately, his fatherunderstood Zeng's feeling. So, he did not let the Siamese cat die for an offering.Nevertheless, they continued the ceremony. Sii Sward was put inside the cage and wasapplied with perfume. The cat misbehaved but was later calmed down when Zengapproached it. During the ceremony, the cat fell asleep. The villagers offered their chantuntil the Siamese cat fell asleep for three days. Then days went by, rain fell. Since then,Sii Sward was elected as the Rain Queen of their village.haping InterpretationWhat is the story all about?How did Sii Sward become instrumental in praying for rain?Do we have the same practice of worshipping here in the Philippines?How do we Filipinos and Thais regard cats?In what ways are Filipinos similar to or different from the Thais in terms of prayingor worshipping?​</h2><br />

Do this in your notebook.MANUEL QUEZON "I was born a poor man, the son of a school teacher in one of the smallest towns in the Philippines–Baler. My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare rice-land which he cultivated. While I was a boy and during my early youth, my father saved as much as he could from his meager salary and from what he could get from his rice-field, only to have a few hundred pesos with which to give me an education. During those Spanish days, a Filipino family could live in a small town on four pesos a month and a supply of rice. Thus, did my family live for years. When I was at the age of five, an aunt of mine started to teach me to read and write. My own father and mother, and the priest of the town later gave me my primary instruction. At the age of nine, I was brought by my father to Manila and began my secondary education at the San Juan de Letran College. First, I lived in the Convent of San Francisco serving as a room-and-mess boy for one priest, receiving no salary, except board and room. Then, my father moved me to the house of an aunt where for some pesos, I roomed and boarded. The house was located in Paco, too far from the Walled City for him who could only use his own feet as a means of transportation. My classes started at seven o'clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health, and the following year, I was taken by my father to San Juan de Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time, the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money, and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to Manila and spoke to my Dominican professors, who, by this time, had become very fond of me, and told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer, but could not pay for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpers in the University of Santo Tomas with room and board and free tuition. Thus, I was able to take up the study of law.''1. Are you inspired by his journey in the pursuit of his dream?2. What do you think was his purpose in sharing this part of his life to his audience?3. How did his story affect your personal views about your studies and your dreams?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1.  President Manuel L. Quezon <strong>can indeed inspired anyone to pursue his/her dreams no matter how difficult their situation could get</strong>.  Compared to his time, we have more opportunities to live a better, more fulfilled life since we live in a freer society.  Moreover, his example as public servant can also inspired people to pay it forward and do what they can to help others.</p><p>2.  For sure, <strong>he wants to inspire the youth of his time to dream big and do what they can to chase their dreams</strong>.  From a simple family that lives on a meager four-peso monthly income, he has come a long way to becoming a leader of the republic.  His fine example has outlived many generations  and continues to inspire people at this time. <strong>He also probably wants to encourage the people to help one another </strong>which is important in uplifting their lives.</p><p>3. It can make young people <strong>rethink how important it is that to value every opportunity that they are handed right now</strong>.  It may be in the form of education which not everyone gets to have.  They better start focusing on things that matter to to them as a student, and make sure they are doing their best.  </p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

My father had, besides his salary, a two-hectare
