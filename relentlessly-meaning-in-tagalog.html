                                            Here is an advice to young artists. "According to French Master Edouard Manet's academic teacher, Thomas Couture: "Experiment! Make mistakes! But whatever you do, make a habit of sincerity. "And from Manet himself,"...Jaws of artistic nature are baffling. It is when an artist has most reason to be discouraged that he is, in fact, drawing near to his own particular truth." Stay true to yourself. Copying Masters will strengthen your technique but ultimately, you will have to wean yourself and make your own art that comes from your soul. Do not be easily discouraged. Hard work is necessary. Work relentlessly, with passion and vigor, and the fruits of your labor will be bountiful" - Plet Bolipata Do you agree or disagree with the artist's advice? -​</a>

                                            Your grandfather has just celebrated his 100th birthday; this is a real feat considering his 3 other siblings have already passed on at least 2 decades ago. During his birthday celebration, you noticed the tall grasses in the nearby vacant lot. Compared to other plants, the grasses seem to grow quickly even after it has just been cut or burned by the village maintenance staff. Process Questions: 1. Why these things happen? 2. What could your grandfather have that his other siblings don't that made him live longer? Why does the grass seem to grow relentlessly despite the efforts to get rid of them? 3. How do plants and animals adapt to changing environmental conditions? 4. Why are there differences among organisms of the same species?​</a>

                                            Once upon a time each of the colors in the world was trying to be accepted for what they were. They pointed out their strengths, hoping that they would be considered the favorite. They all wanted to be respected and appreciated for who they were, but felt other colors were attempting to dominate the spectrum and gain the spotlight. For instance…And so all the colors went on boasting and quarreling, each convinced of their own superiority. Soon, their quarreling became louder and louder. Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening! Thunder rolled and boomed! Rain started to pour down relentlessly. The colors crouched down in fear drawing close to one another for comfort.
In the midst of the clamor, a Voice began to speak: “You foolish colors, fighting amongst yourselves, each trying to dominate the rest. Don’t you know you were each made for a special purpose, unique and different? Join hands with one another and come to me.”
Doing as they were told, the colors united and joined hands. The Voice continued: “From now on, when it rains, each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of colors as a reminder that you are all important and you can all live in peace. Let the rainbow be a sign of hope for tomorrow.”
And so, whenever a good rain washes the world and a rainbow appears in the sky, let us remember to appreciate one another.</a>

                                            The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</a>

                            10. Here is an advice to young artists. "According to French Master Edouard Manet's academic teacher, Thomas Couture: "Experiment! Make mistakes! But whatever you do, make a habit of sincerity. "And from Manet himself,"...Jaws of artistic nature are baffling. It is when an artist has most reason to be discouraged that he is, in fact, drawing near to his own particular truth." Stay true to yourself. Copying Masters will strengthen your technique but ultimately, you will have to wean yourself and make your own art that comes from your soul. Do not be easily discouraged. Hard work is necessary. Work relentlessly, with passion and vigor, and the fruits of your labor will be bountiful" - Plet Bolipata Do you agree or disagree with the artist's advice? -​</h2><br />

During his birthday celebration, you noticed the tall grasses in the nearby vacant lot. Compared to other plants, the grasses seem to grow quickly even after it has just been cut or burned by the village maintenance staff. Process Questions: 1. Why these things happen? 2. What could your grandfather have that his other siblings don't that made him live longer? Why does the grass seem to grow relentlessly despite the efforts to get rid of them? 3. How do plants and animals adapt to changing environmental conditions? 4. Why are there differences among organisms of the same species?​</h2><br />

                            15. Once upon a time each of the colors in the world was trying to be accepted for what they were. They pointed out their strengths, hoping that they would be considered the favorite. They all wanted to be respected and appreciated for who they were, but felt other colors were attempting to dominate the spectrum and gain the spotlight. For instance…And so all the colors went on boasting and quarreling, each convinced of their own superiority. Soon, their quarreling became louder and louder. Suddenly there was a startling flash of bright lightening! Thunder rolled and boomed! Rain started to pour down relentlessly. The colors crouched down in fear drawing close to one another for comfort.
In the midst of the clamor, a Voice began to speak: “You foolish colors, fighting amongst yourselves, each trying to dominate the rest. Don’t you know you were each made for a special purpose, unique and different? Join hands with one another and come to me.”
Doing as they were told, the colors united and joined hands. The Voice continued: “From now on, when it rains, each of you will stretch across the sky in a great bow of colors as a reminder that you are all important and you can all live in peace. Let the rainbow be a sign of hope for tomorrow.”
And so, whenever a good rain washes the world and a rainbow appears in the sky, let us remember to appreciate one another.</h2><br />

                            16. The Philippines’ COVID-19 Response: Securitising the Pandemic and Disciplining the Pasaway Karl Hapal (2021) Duterte has securitised COVID-19. This was achieved by fulfilling the three main elements of securitisation – the identification of an existential threat, emergency measures, and breaking free of rules. The securitisation of COVID-19 relied on framing the pandemic as war – a fight for the nation‟s survival. This was used to justify the draconian response by the government in an attempt to suppress the spread of the virus. This was primarily achieved by utilising and expanding the powers of the state‟s law enforcement apparatus. While Duterte has successfully securitised COVID-19, he has done so in a peculiar way. Duterte‟s securitising act relied on his populist rhetoric – a populist securitising act so to speak. Seen this way, Duterte‟s populist rhetoric served as the speech act that argued for and legitimised the securitisation of COVID-19. A key element of his populist securitising act was projecting the Philippines under siege by a sinister menace that may undermine the well-being of Filipinos. Duterte‟s populist securitising act invariably produced the pasaway archetype, an erring and bullheaded subject who, through its behaviour, became the embodiment of the virus‟ deadly qualities. Consequently, this was used to justify the intense policing and disciplining campaign against the pasaway. The war against COVID-19 turned into a war against the pasaway. The war against the pasaway is an attempt by the government to protect virtuous citizens from an unwanted and undesirable “other.” The disproportionate focus on the pasaway, however, is not only to mitigate its bullheaded behaviour. It is also informed by deep-seated class prejudices – the pasaway, in some ways, resembling the colonised and racialised other. The bifurcated narrative and the concomitant legitimisation of the use of the state‟s coercive power have long been used to produce, maintain, and reinforce societal divides. Beyond class, however, the underlying discourse that informed the production of the pasaway soon spread to other groups‟ perceived derailing of governmental efforts against the virus. In this sense, the pasaway became an empty signifier representing any other behaviour or actions deemed disagreeable. As an empty signifier, the campaign to address the pasaway extended to not only arresting bullheaded individuals but also to silence dissent. While the pasaway has become an encompassing pejorative term, it still relied on the bifurcated depiction of Filipino society and the need to save the virtuous from the errant. These dualist and oppositional narratives are, however, not new. They resemble what has informed and animated Duterte‟s campaigns against illegal drugs, criminality, corruption, oligarchy, communism, and so on. These narratives serve to present a bifurcated society, an existential threat, and an accompanying justification to pursue actions with force and haste in the name of social justice and national integrity. Take, for example, the war on drugs. Duterte depicted the widespread sale and use of illegal drugs as “a clear national security threat […] an invasion of a new kind […] [and] a war against our families and children” (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2020). Moreover, Duterte was able to frame the war on drugs as a noble crusade to salvage the Filipino nation (Hapal, 2019). In this crusade, society is seen as composed of good people and of demons (demonyo). The role of the government (particularly law enforcement) is “predictably, like avenging angels, to eliminate the demons to protect society – in other words, to keep the integrity of the „thin blue line‟” (Jensen and Hapal, 2018: 49). In this sense, the war against COVID-19 may be understood in conjunction with Duterte‟s other “wars on […]” Amid the pandemic, the government relentlessly continued its war on drugs, criminality, and corruption; intensified its war against terrorism alongside the passage of the controversial Anti-Terrorism Law; and escalated its campaign to dismantle so-called oligarchs, ABS-CBN – the largest media network in the Philippines – as one of the casualties. These wars are being fought to address a clear and present threat to ensure the well-being and future of the nation. And, more importantly, it presents an enemy to vanquish. The war on COVID-19 had serious consequences. Through the archetype of the pasaway, the government has, wittingly or unwittingly, turned the Filipino people into the enemy. This came to be as the virus, initially conceived as an “unseen enemy” creeping to infect, kill, and upend the lives of Filipinos, took a corporeal form. In other words, COVID-19‟s deadly and devastating qualities were soon embodied with the bullheaded character of the pasaway. It became the enemy order and, consequently, the object of disciplining and punishment. pasagot namn sa nakakaalam maraming salamat​</h2><br />
