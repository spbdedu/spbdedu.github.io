accomplished and what may not. And above all, he or she must have the

                            1. what is the history of filipino food culture​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The origins of Filipino food lie with the Malayo-Polynesians, who were responsible for its most common ingredient: rice.</strong> Around 3200 BC, they settled in the Philippines and brought farming and cooking methods that included steaming, boiling, and roasting over a fire.</p><br />
                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="ibat-ibang-kulay-ng-putong-filipino-history-not-the-food">
                            2. Ibat ibang kulay  ng putong filipino history not the food</h2><br />
                        <p>Ang putong ay anumang kasuotan, karaniwang tela, para sa ulo. Sa sinaunang tao, ang pútong ay maaaring nagsimula para sa praktikal na gamit. Maaaring pantakip ito sa ulo laban sa init, ulan, at proteksiyon laban sa anumang babagsak mula sa itaas. Naglalagay ng pútong noon ang nag-iigib upang higit na mainam ang pagbalanse ng sinusunong na banga hábang lumalakad. Ganoon din ang silbi ng tela sa ilalim ng sunong na bilao o bakul, lalo’t mabigat ang nilalaman.</p><p></p><p>Ngunit ang tunay na pútong ay simbolo ng karangalan, gaya ng pagsasabing “pútong na korona” para sa hari o para sa lakambini ng pagdiriwang. Para sa mga Muslim ang pútong ay nagsisilbing palatandaan na sila ay Muslim. Ang karaniwang kulay ng pútong na ginagamit ng mga Muslim na lalaki ay itim o anumang may iisang kulay. Samantala, ang pútong ng kababaihang Muslim ay may iba’t ibang kulay at disenyo na nagsisilbi ring palamuti sa kanilang katawan.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes they we're</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Importance of Food to Filipino Culture</p><p>Food shaped the way Filipinos live. Aside from the food itself, there are priceless memories shared with whoever they’re with, which make it more special. Food glues foreigners, friends, and the whole family together (regardless of lifestyle differences). This can be observed in events like birthdays, graduation, anniversaries, or just a simple get-together. This value is pretty common among Asians but Filipinos take it to a new level. When you happen to buy ice-cold beer from a convenience store. People won’t hesitate to approach you and invite you to a table of pulutan (little amounts of food) and buckets of beer.</p><p></p><p>Filipinos just naturally bring you homey vibes. They even invite people, even strangers during fiestas, to dine with them in their humble abode. This tradition may also showcase a social status. You’ll see golden utensils and cutlery beside your plate with dishes whose recipes are preserved in their ancestry. After the party, hosts would even give food for you to bring home.

A simple gesture like this tells that there are some things money can’t buy.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Filipinos are still culturally divided because they live in the archipelago, and this applies to food too. Each region takes great pride in its unique recipes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Frankly, Filipinos just eat whatever food is on the table without being curious about its history. It’s awesome to know that influential chefs promote the use of locally harvested food ingredients in TV shows. Highlighting the rich food heritage from different foreign cultures explains how it transformed lives through time and contributed to the joys and laughter in many unforgettable events.</p><p></p><p>What Makes Filipino Food Unique?</p><p>Filipino food is simple to cook and always a pleasure to serve and eat. The blend of flavor and texture makes them stand out. Also, the warmth extended to family and friends motivates Filipinos to ‘cook with love.’ The typical Filipino meal is composed of vegetables, seafood, dairy, meat, and rice. In fiestas, food is displayed, in its appetizing and mouth-watering color, in every home as aesthetic. The naturally produced aroma seduces anyone and traps them in affective means. Its smell makes it unique because of the secret concoction of vegetables, herbs, oils, citrus, and spices.</p><p></p><p>One certain dish can be cooked in many ways and this shows Filipinos’ penchant for creativity. Everything can be changed, namely, the cooking method, flavor, and iingredient. These make each Filipino food you encounter, exciting, and surprising.</p><p></p><p>Unlike with other countries conventionally cook one dish by the book, Filipinos cook it in procedures and ingredients signature to the region where the recipe is invented. Because flavors in the Philippines are often strong, having only a few spices packs a punch. Here, dishes with simple and few ingredients are more delicious. </p><p></p><p>The food tradition is much pronounced on every occasion. There are stories linked to such food. Some friend would ask. Every Filipino dish you taste is a product of love, merry, history, tradition, and passion.</p><p></p><p>Why Rice is Important in the Philippines?</p><p>Rice is part of almost every Filipino meal. rice contributes to the priceless memories that Filipino food brings. It is a nutritious source of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and especially, carbohydrates. Almost everybody can afford it since the Philippines is primarily an agricultural country. Restaurants may even offer ‘unli-rice,’ meaning unlimited rice. This means you’ll add a small amount of money to upgrade your one cup rice meal.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p>Hi everyone, my name is [Name] and I am excited to share with you one of my favorite Filipino dishes with the influence of the Spanish era. This dish is called "Callos," and it is a hearty stew made with beef tripe, chorizo, and garbanzo beans. In this blog post, I will share with you how to prepare this dish, its history, and its health benefits.</p><p></p><p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p><p>To prepare Callos, you will need the following ingredients:</p>1 kg beef tripe, cleaned and boiled until tender1 cup white wine1 cup tomato sauce1 cup beef broth1 cup garbanzo beans, cooked1/2 cup sliced chorizo1/2 cup sliced bell peppers1/2 cup sliced onions4 cloves garlic, minced2 bay leaves2 tbsp olive oilSalt and pepper to taste<p></p><p>To start, heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the garlic and onions, and saute until fragrant. Add the chorizo and saute for another minute. Then, add the beef tripe and saute for another 5 minutes. Pour in the white wine and let it simmer for 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, beef broth, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pot and let it simmer for 30 minutes. Add the garbanzo beans, bell peppers, and continue to simmer for another 10 minutes. Once everything is cooked, remove the bay leaves and serve hot.</p><p></p><p><strong>History:</strong></p><p>Callos has been a popular dish in the Philippines since the Spanish colonial era. This dish originated in Spain and was brought to the Philippines by Spanish colonizers. The dish has evolved over time with the addition of local ingredients and flavors. It is a hearty and flavorful stew that is commonly served during special occasions and celebrations.</p><p></p><p><strong>Health Benefits:</strong></p><p>Callos is a protein-rich dish that is a good source of iron, zinc, and vitamin B12.

Underline the sub topics in each paragraph. Do this in pair and exchange 
your answers with your partner.1-2. As one goes over the history of man with its meaningless cycle of war and 
peace, triumphs and disasters, faith in some great purpose or some grand 
design becomes more and more difficult to maintain. Providence appears as 
an illusion. The absurdity of existence haunts modern man. If he would live 
honestly, without false comfort, not like a child but as a man, he must rely solely on himself.Main Idea: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3-4. Why does the Philippines have nutritional problems? Our country is rich 
in agricultural and food resources. There is an abundance of fish and other 
sea food in our waters. Vegetables grow abundantly on our lands with the 
slightest attention paid to the plants. The simple reason is that Filipinos do 
not know how to eat the right kind of food.Main Idea: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5-6. A good senator is a composite of several intangibles. He must emanate 
ultimate good faith. He or she knows when to compromise and must be willing 
to abide dissent. He or she has the ability to concentrate on what is important 
and necessary. A good senator must be one more in sensing what may be 
accomplished and what may not. And above all, he or she must have the 
interest of others at heart.Main Idea: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
