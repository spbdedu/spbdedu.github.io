                                            THE WIND AND THE SUN By James Baldwin Once the Wind and the Sun had a dispute as to which was the stronger of the two. "Do you see that traveler plodding along the road?" said the Wind. "Let us both try our strength on him, and let the one who can first strip him of his cloak be the winner." "Agreed," said the Sun. The Wind began first. He blew a blast which sent the leaves flying through air; he raised clouds of dust in the road, bent the tops of the trees to the ground, and even tore up one sturdy oak by the roots. But the traveler only drew his cloak the more tightly around his shoulders, and kept on his way. Then the Sun began. He burst out from behind a black cloud, and, little by little, darted his sultry beams upon the traveler's head and back. The man did not notice this much at first, but soon the heat was so great that he stopped to wipe the sweat from his face. "Ah!" he said, "I cannot stand this. It is so hot that one might as well be in an oven!" Then he threw off his cloak, and carried it under his arm; and when he came to a tree by the roadside he sat down under its shade to cool himself. After that, the Wind never claimed to be stronger than the Sun. k Answer each question. 1. What had the dispute been between the Wind and the Sun? 2. What did the Wind say to the Sun? 3. What did the Wind do then? 4. How did Sun try its strength? 5. What did the Wind never claim again?​</a>

                            9. THE WIND AND THE SUN By James Baldwin Once the Wind and the Sun had a dispute as to which was the stronger of the two. "Do you see that traveler plodding along the road?" said the Wind. "Let us both try our strength on him, and let the one who can first strip him of his cloak be the winner." "Agreed," said the Sun. The Wind began first. He blew a blast which sent the leaves flying through air; he raised clouds of dust in the road, bent the tops of the trees to the ground, and even tore up one sturdy oak by the roots. But the traveler only drew his cloak the more tightly around his shoulders, and kept on his way. Then the Sun began. He burst out from behind a black cloud, and, little by little, darted his sultry beams upon the traveler's head and back. The man did not notice this much at first, but soon the heat was so great that he stopped to wipe the sweat from his face. "Ah!" he said, "I cannot stand this. It is so hot that one might as well be in an oven!" Then he threw off his cloak, and carried it under his arm; and when he came to a tree by the roadside he sat down under its shade to cool himself. After that, the Wind never claimed to be stronger than the Sun. k Answer each question. 1. What had the dispute been between the Wind and the Sun? 2. What did the Wind say to the Sun? 3. What did the Wind do then? 4. How did Sun try its strength? 5. What did the Wind never claim again?​</h2><br />
