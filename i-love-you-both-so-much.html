selfishness. I can see that you are both in love with each other. Who am I to oppose? From

This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay)I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship.

Watch the music video I DONT WANT YOU TO GO by Kyla. After watching, write your insights based from the music video you are watching
heres the song 
I Don’t Want You to Go
(Music version: by Kyla)
Here I am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holding on
When all but the passion's gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
And heroes die
When they ignore the cause inside
But they learn from what's left behind
And fight for something else
And so it goes
That we have both learned how to grow
(Repeat)
Oh it's just too much
Takin' all the whole world all by myself
But it's not enough
Unless I stop trusting somebody else Somebody else
And love again
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go, no
Maybe we were tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
Oh no, don't want you to go</a>

                                            Read the excerpt below:
An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.
Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)
It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children?
Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake.
Mr. Serge: (Gay)
I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And
I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)
It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot
resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

                                            Write a letter of love and appreciation. Thanking oneselffor being unique and for the gifts you've received-talents, skills, etc. (Youmay also do a video, like in the example shown in the material, or just simply writing a letter-the choice is yours)Here are tips and ideas:· Don't just write "Dear self." Instead, write,"To my best self" or "To my one true love" or evenuse your nickname like, "Dear lovable ________."· Start off by saying why you are writing the letter. Itcould be something like, "I feel so full of love for you today that I justhad to express my feelings." Or, It is unique, just like my love foryourself."· This is where you describe yourself and how you feelabout being you. It's important too. If you are someone who is sentimentaland flowery, then your letter should be, too. But if you're more of a funnyperson, don't be afraid to add a little humor or silliness here. These shouldbe your words and your voice, speaking from the heart. Recognize your presentsituation and talk about it. Recognize your strengths and be thankful. Embraceyour uniqueness and giftedness. Be honest of what you feel.· In the last paragraph, you want to both tie back to thebeginning and look to the future. You might say, "It's hard for me toexpress everything I am feeling right now; these words are only a small measureof my love for you. So I am thankful that I _____________ how much I loveyou." Or, if you started by writing about the uniqueness of your life, Iam so glad that you are my _______________(referring yourself).

I Don't Want You To Go
Lani Hall
Here ( eye, I, aye) am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how ( eat, it ) all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holdin' on
When all but the ( fashion’s, passion's) gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' (two,too, to) hard
It's crazy, 'cause it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart, but I (no , know)
That I don't want (hue, you, ewe) to go
And heroes (dye , die)
When they ignore the ( cost, cause) inside
But they learned from what's left behind
And fight (four, for) something else
And (saw, so) it goes
That we have (boat, both, bath)learned how to
growAnd from the start
Maybe we were tryin' ( to, too, two) hard
It's crazy, 'cause it's breakin' ( hour,are,
our) hearts
Things can fall apart, but I know
That I don't want ( ewe, you, hue) to go
Oh, it's just (two, to, too) much
Takin' on the (hole, whole) world all by
myself
But it’s not enough
Unless I stop trustin' somebody else
Somebody else, and love again
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' ( to, too, two) hard
It's crazy, 'cause it's breakin' ( hour, our,
are) hearts
Things can fall apart, but I (no, know)
That I don't want (hew , you, ewe) to go
(repeat this stanza)
Oh no, I don't want you to go
Say that you won't go</a>

                                            Love Your FamilyMy name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat to scratch a man to 
death!

                                            Here I am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holding on
When all but the passion's gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
And heroes die
When they ignore the cause inside
But they leam from what's left behind
And fight for something else
And so it goes
That we have both learned how to grow
2. Vocabulary words:
3. Images that represent the message of the song:
Oh, it's just too much
Takin' all the whole world all by myself
But it's not enough
Unless I stop trusting somebody else
Somebody else
And love again
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go, no
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
Oh no, don't want you to go

                                            An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the "SAME SEX MARRIAGE "that is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals. Father Nael: (Priest) It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society) It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay) I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way. Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian) It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay) If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy. After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument and why? Write your answer in your Reflection notebook.​</a>

                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

Watch the music video I DONT WANT YOU TO GO by Kyla. After watching, write your insights based from the music video you are watching
heres the song 
I Don’t Want You to Go
(Music version: by Kyla)
Here I am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holding on
When all but the passion's gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
And heroes die
When they ignore the cause inside
But they learn from what's left behind
And fight for something else
And so it goes
That we have both learned how to grow
(Repeat)
Oh it's just too much
Takin' all the whole world all by myself
But it's not enough
Unless I stop trusting somebody else Somebody else
And love again
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go, no
Maybe we were tryin' to hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
Oh no, don't want you to go</h2><br />
                        ANSWER<p></p><p>The song is all about love that a person don't want the other person to leave right also its a sad song or broken song that melts you hearts. The song telling us that in the world of love even if we've been hurt we just still love again and all the times you fall you've been learning a lot in the world and that makes your heart more complicated than before.</p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><br />

                            13. Read the excerpt below:
An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind
aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making
decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it
should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas
which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine
several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the SAME SEX MARRIAGE that
is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals.
Father Nael: (Priest)
It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a
sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the
commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.
Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)
It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children?
Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake.
Mr. Serge: (Gay)
I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And
I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.
Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)
It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot
resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and
feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or
have married legally.
Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)
If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is
meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their
relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.
Activity 2: My Personal Insights:
After reading the six arguments on the given issues above, which do you think the best argument
and why? Write your answer in your Reflection notebook.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The priest's argument is based from the Bible.</p><p></p><p>Casiana's argument is based on what is accepted in society.</p><p></p><p>The G*y's argument are based from what is secured as legal.</p><p></p><p>The l*sbian's argument is also based on what is legal.</p><p></p><p>Jennifer's argument is based from what her gay son will do or feel.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the G*y's argument is the best for me even though they have the same concept with lesbian because the Gay's argument is short but clearly delivered and comprehensive.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The g*y is telling that marriage is the only way to make a two couple legal. That is why he said, he secured and have a peace of mind, cause they will not think what the society will tell them for being together.

Thanking oneselffor being unique and for the gifts you've received-talents, skills, etc. (Youmay also do a video, like in the example shown in the material, or just simply writing a letter-the choice is yours)Here are tips and ideas:· Don't just write "Dear self." Instead, write,"To my best self" or "To my one true love" or evenuse your nickname like, "Dear lovable ________."· Start off by saying why you are writing the letter. Itcould be something like, "I feel so full of love for you today that I justhad to express my feelings." Or, It is unique, just like my love foryourself."· This is where you describe yourself and how you feelabout being you. It's important too. If you are someone who is sentimentaland flowery, then your letter should be, too. But if you're more of a funnyperson, don't be afraid to add a little humor or silliness here. These shouldbe your words and your voice, speaking from the heart. Recognize your presentsituation and talk about it. Recognize your strengths and be thankful. Embraceyour uniqueness and giftedness. Be honest of what you feel.· In the last paragraph, you want to both tie back to thebeginning and look to the future. You might say, "It's hard for me toexpress everything I am feeling right now; these words are only a small measureof my love for you. So I am thankful that I _____________ how much I loveyou." Or, if you started by writing about the uniqueness of your life, Iam so glad that you are my _______________(referring yourself). I can't waitfor the time to come that I( imagining your future self)____________________.Pls help me :(</h2><br />

I Don't Want You To Go
Lani Hall
Here ( eye, I, aye) am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how ( eat, it ) all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holdin' on
When all but the ( fashion’s, passion's) gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' (two,too, to) hard
It's crazy, 'cause it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart, but I (no , know)
That I don't want (hue, you, ewe) to go
And heroes (dye , die)
When they ignore the ( cost, cause) inside
But they learned from what's left behind
And fight (four, for) something else
And (saw, so) it goes
That we have (boat, both, bath)learned how to
growAnd from the start
Maybe we were tryin' ( to, too, two) hard
It's crazy, 'cause it's breakin' ( hour,are,
our) hearts
Things can fall apart, but I know
That I don't want ( ewe, you, hue) to go
Oh, it's just (two, to, too) much
Takin' on the (hole, whole) world all by
myself
But it’s not enough
Unless I stop trustin' somebody else
Somebody else, and love again
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' ( to, too, two) hard
It's crazy, 'cause it's breakin' ( hour, our,
are) hearts
Things can fall apart, but I (no, know)
That I don't want (hew , you, ewe) to go

I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

                            25. Here I am
Alone and I don't understand
Exactly how it all began
The dream just walked away
I'm holding on
When all but the passion's gone
And from the start
Maybe I was tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' my heart
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
And heroes die
When they ignore the cause inside
But they leam from what's left behind
And fight for something else
And so it goes
That we have both learned how to grow
2. Vocabulary words:
3. Images that represent the message of the song:
Oh, it's just too much
Takin' all the whole world all by myself
But it's not enough
Unless I stop trusting somebody else
Somebody else
And love again
And from the start
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go, no
Maybe we were tryin' too hard
It's crazy coz it's breakin' our hearts
Things can fall apart but I know
That I don't want you to go
Oh no, don't want you to go

You are important to me because we've been best friends since we were just kids, but
this man right here, he is the only man I ever loved.

selfishness. I can see that you are both in love with each other. Who am I to oppose? From

                            27. An individual cannot live his or her life just agreeing with everybody he or she meets. A critical mind aided by a philosophy can help us from our own personal point of view that can guide us in making decisions and actions when faced with a problem. Each individual’s point of view is unique but it should be based on sound and reasonable ideas and views. We would be able to come up with ideas which are truthful and can be accepted universally through the study Philosophy. Let us imagine several individuals reacting to news on the television and radio about the "SAME SEX MARRIAGE "that is being proposed in the congress. Let’s analyze the opinions of these individuals. Father Nael: (Priest) It’s not allowed to marry with the same sex. Married is for a man and a woman. This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society) It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay) I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way. Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian) It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay) If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship. I would agree just for him to be happy.

                            29. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

They were in the park near their school and both are waiting for their friends to arrive for a group study. “ Why are you so lonely huh?!”, Pablo asked, “ Did someone hurt you?”, he continued. Marissa turned her head to him and answered, “ No, that is not the problem.” in a low voice she said, “ I really miss Grandma but I have to wait next year to see her.” she continued and sigh, “ Oh! I’m sorry to hear that.” Pablo said sympathizing her. Marissa continued, “ if I had a private plane, I could visit her in New York anytime I want, right?”, Marissa said. Pablo held her hands and said, “ If I have wings to fly you there right now, I would gladly do it for you.” Pablo joked.
