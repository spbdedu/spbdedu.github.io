Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</a>

                                            true or false 1. During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2. Because of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, its geographical features, and the presence of various ethno-linguistic groups in the country, regional literature has become rich and varied. 3. Oral and written literatures were not present in the Filipino culture before the colonizers came. 4. The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5. The separate, yet parallel developments of Philippine literature in English and those in Tagalog and other languages of the archipelago during the American period only proved that literature and writing in whatever language and in whatever climate were able to survive mainly through the active imagination of writers. 6. Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 9. Filipino literature was given a break during the Japanese period. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13. Imagery in poetry pertains to mental pictures. 14. Literature developed alongside Philippine history is a valid observation of literary development in the Philippines. 15. The use of the vernacular in regional literature is encouraged so that the culture and tradition of a people are upheld despite effects of modernization.​</a>

                        <p>Si Dr. Jose Rizal ay isa sa mga pinakamahalagang bayani ng Pilipinas. Siya ay isinilang noong Hunyo 19, 1861 sa Calamba, Laguna. Si Rizal ay isang magaling na manunulat, makata, pintor, at siya ay nag-aral ng medisina sa Unibersidad ng Santo Tomas at nag-aral din sa ibang bansa tulad ng Espanya at Alemanya.</p><p></p><p>Isa sa mga naging kontribusyon ni Rizal sa kasaysayan ay ang kanyang mga akda na nagpakita ng kanyang pagmamahal sa bayan at kanyang paglaban sa mga pang-aabuso ng mga Kastila. Ang kanyang mga nobela tulad ng Noli Me Tangere at El Filibusterismo ay nagpapakita ng kalagayan ng mga Pilipino sa panahon ng pananakop ng mga Kastila. Ang kanyang mga sulat na tulad ng "Sa Aking Mga Kababata" ay nagpapakita ng kanyang pag-ibig sa bansa at kanyang hangarin para sa kalayaan ng mga Pilipino.</p><p></p><p>Dahil sa kanyang mga panulat, si Rizal ay naging bantog at kinilala bilang isa sa mga lider ng kilusang pang-reporma sa Pilipinas. Ipinaglaban niya ang karapatan ng mga Pilipino na magkaroon ng edukasyon at kalayaan.</p><p></p><p>Ngunit dahil sa kanyang mga paninindigan at mga sulat, si Rizal ay naging biktima ng pang-aapi ng mga Kastila. Siya ay hinatulan ng kamatayan sa pamamagitan ng garrote noong Disyembre 30, 1896.</p><p></p><p>Ngunit ang kanyang paghihirap ay hindi nagdulot ng takot sa mga Pilipino. Sa halip, ito ang naging inspirasyon upang magpakita ng tapang at maglaban para sa kalayaan ng bansa. Hanggang sa ngayon, si Rizal ay isa pa rin sa mga pinakamahalagang bayani ng Pilipinas at ang kanyang mga aral ay patuloy na nagbibigay inspirasyon sa mga Pilipino na magpakita ng pagmamahal sa bayan at magpakatapang sa paglaban para sa katarungan at kalayaan.</p><br />

Princess Urduja is a mere legend, and not a historical figure.
According to legend, the Filipino heroine Princess Urduja ruled an island called Tawalisi in the 14th century. She led a group of warrior women called Kinalakihan, or the Amazons, across battlefields, and was known for her kindness and intelligence. She is said to have taken no husband because she would only choose a man who was braver, wiser, and stronger than she was, and nobody had enough guts to try to beat her in battle. However, it’s also believed by many that Urduja actually existed — as there were records of her in the accounts of Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta. A common theory is that Tawalisi was located in what is now known as Pangasinan, although common guesses for the princess’ native home also include Java, Cambodia, and China.
Lapu-Lapu killed Ferdinand Magellan.
Even first-graders know Lapu-Lapu, the ruler of Mactan who is also the first Philippine hero. He led his men to win the battle of Mactan against Portuguese colonizer Ferdinand Magellan (who probably preferred to be called “explorer” and, by the way, obviously did not “discover” the Philippines), and is usually said to have killed Magellan in the fight. The image may inspire nationalism, but the truth is, it’s impossible to tell whether Magellan did lose his life directly at the hands of Lapu-Lapu, who may be less young and vital than he is commonly depicted.
Jose Rizal wrote “Sa Aking Mga Kabata” in his childhood.
The poem “Sa Aking Mga Kabata,” written in Tagalog about embracing one’s native language, is often attributed to Dr. Jose Rizal, who supposedly wrote it when he was seven years old — “proof,” according to some, of his precocious nature and love of country. Historians such as Ambeth Ocampo, however, have researched and written in opposition of this, stating that there’s no evidence (whether it be a manuscript, a published byline, or an assertion from Rizal himself) supporting Rizal’s authorship of the work. In addition to this, Rizal did not have a strong enough command of Tagalog to match the fluency of the poem.
The viral love letter “Liham Para Kay Oryang” was written by Andres Bonifacio.
In 2015, the work of epistolary fiction “Liham Para Kay Oryang,” written by playwright Eljay Castro Deldoc as though it were a letter from Andres Bonifacio to his wife Gregoria de Jesus a few nights before he was killed, went viral on social media and reached far enough that people began to believe Bonifacio had actually written it. It was romantic and relayed the urgency of love and loss during wartime — but it was just the writer’s interpretation of historical events. On that note, a real poem written by Gregoria de Jesus, titled “Magmula, Giliw, Nang Ikaw ay Pumanaw,” was verified by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. Talking about her grief over losing Bonifacio, it was copied by hand by her second husband Julio Nakpil, and is now on display in the Bahay-Nakpil museum.
Fernando Poe Sr. served as the model for the Oblation.
Commissioned for the University of the Philippines by then-president Rafael Palma and funded by the enrollees in 1935, the iconic statue known as the Oblation, or simply Oble, was created by Guillermo E. Tolentino and based on Rizal’s poem “Mi Ultimo Adios.” The symbol and touchstone of any UP campus is often said to have taken its physique from actor-director Fernando Poe, Sr., who was a UP student at the time of its creation; however, records show that Anastacio Caedo, a student assistant of Tolentino’s, and Caedo’s brother-in-law Virgilio Raymundo served as the models and references. Another fact that might not be all that well known? The original sculpture is located not in front of Quezon Hall along UP Diliman’s University Avenue, but instead inside Gonzales Hall.
The yo-yo was invented by ancient Filipinos.
It’s too simple to say the yo-yo was invented by a Filipino, and it’s almost impossible to determine its true origins: it traces its existence back to ancient Greece and arrived in Europe in the 1800s, long before it was trademarked and sold en masse in America. But in the late 1920s, a Filipino bellboy named Pedro Flores, who had traveled to the United States in hopes of studying law, innovated a stringing method that elevated the yo-yo from being a simple toy to the type we all know and can do tricks with today. He mass-produced his creation and established a yo-yo manufacturing company, but eventually sold the rights.</h2><br />

During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2. Because of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, its geographical features, and the presence of various ethno-linguistic groups in the country, regional literature has become rich and varied. 3.

The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5.

Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 9. Filipino literature was given a break during the Japanese period. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13. Imagery in poetry pertains to mental pictures. 14. Literature developed alongside Philippine history is a valid observation of literary development in the Philippines. 15. The use of the vernacular in regional literature is encouraged so that the culture and tradition of a people are upheld despite effects of modernization.​</h2><br />
