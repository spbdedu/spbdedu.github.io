By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.

The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

Being grateful to haveomeone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn toor love and support. With the loss of my father, I've also lost my sounding board. Allcan glean from that is it's time to look within myself and make proper assessments.f I can't make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling fornything.Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Willmiss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up oursuitcase of memories, pick out my favourite one, and dream about it, talk about it, orwrite about it. Maybe I can't pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn'tmean he's gone.Next week, I'm off to Istanbul to explore their art scene.

However, this trend has different meaning in Malaysia and Paraguay disapprove of giving gifts because they may consider it to be bribe. In Malaysia, you can't give a gift if you don't have a personal relationship with that person. Yet, in some countries like Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines, exchanging gifts is related to tradition. It is important for them to give gifts to each other. When someone decides to show his/her respect or love for someone with a present, he/she has to consider where this person comes from.pa answer ngayon pls i need po​</a>

Examine the author's stand on this topic."How much are you supposed to like what you do? Unless you know that, you don't know when to stop searching. And if, like most people, you underestimate it, you'll tend to stop searching too early. You'll end up doing something chosen for you by your parents, or the desire to make money, or prestige-or sheer inertia. Here's an upper bound: Do what you love doesn't mean, do what you would like to do most this second. Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first. It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no."

Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

                                            fice and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our "big girl ants" and be brave, even if we're not. lso, there's a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have omeone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to or love and support. With the loss of my father, I've also lost my sounding board. All can glean from that is it's time to look within myself and make proper assessments. f I can't make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for nything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favourite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can't pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn't mean he's gone. Next week, I'm off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized. Questions: 1. What is the story all about? 2. Who are the characters? 3. Where is the story happens? 4.

                                            I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.

It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism.The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</a>

                                            How would you define this issue based on the information in the text? THE ISSUE:But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden failures and disappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewal of what was lost. Strong family ties and relationship was built – evenTiktok videos are well-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment is smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage – pollution temporarily halted for a month of locked down; most people cultivated the land – even pots and plastic containers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled – most learned how to follow rules and how to wait and give turns to others. Diligence in earning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. Health was even worth the price! - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetables always. Education had never stopped upon finding means – different learning modalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered – giving and sharing were evident; and most especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone is included. And that’s for our good - to keep us safe from harm and to stay alive. As I raised my head, I know that this is just a test of time. A period of everyone’s life to be resilient, cared, hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic will end the soonest and everything will just be a part of the history of human life.​</a>

                            3. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2. What does the author say about the relationship of love and giving. 3. What was the attendant grabber used by the author? 4. What paragraph reveals the relation of the topic (numerical answer) 5.

The Parable of the Rainbow Colors 
Juan M. Flavier
It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors. No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restraint and humility.
 But as time went on, the colors declarations became stronger and haughty with an overtone which tended to out down the other colors. Their claim became very explicit as to who was the best color. 
It reached the point when the colors were actually quarrelling. 
Said the color RED, “I am the brightest! for red is the most striking. Why? Life-sustaining blood is colored red. I represent courage and bravery. Even love symbols like the heart and the roses presented are red in color.”
The color YELLOW retorted, “What can be brighter than my yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and of warmth. Without me, only the eye-glaring ones remains.”
What an outlandish claim! Interposed the color ORANGE. “Sunrise is orange, not
yellow. I am more important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange.”
Well, if you are talking about vegetables and leaves, you are referring to my color, declared the color GREEN. “I am the symbol of life. All that thrives in the fields and the forests is the greenery I provide. I am the most important color.”
The color BLUE could not help it anymore so it shouted, “What can be more expansive than the skies and the seas? Do you forget that the farthest skies and the deepest seas are blue? I represent patriotism. I stand for the depth of feelings and extensive spaces.”
The color INDIGO came out with a statement, “You talk about wide areas. I hope you realized the largest area in the world is silence and I represent that dimension with my color. It means thoughtfulness. It is prayer expressed in the deepest of feelings.”
“Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is VIOLET, shouted the color. I am wisdom and authority. What can be more overwhelming?”
Suddenly, the rain interrupted the contentious exchange of arguments. “Yes, you all have your unique features. But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need each other to give the mix of colors for beauty. Because of your quarrelling. . . God has asked me to inform you of a decision. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will all appear together. You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. The rainbow in the sky.”
With that, the rain disappeared.
Task 5 Analyze the situations based on the “Parable of Rainbow Colors” written by Juan M. Flavier. Choose which color of the rainbow shows the following scenario in our lives. 
1. The Frontliners are doing their bests to save lives. 
2. A soldier is dying in a battle because of love for country. 
3. A journalist has the power to change someone’s way of thinking. 
4. The farmers are very happy because of the good harvest this year. 
5. There are volunteers who planted plants and trees to save our forests.

Even Einstein probably had moments when he wanted to have a cup of coffee, but told himself he ought to finish what he was working on first.

If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no."

Flavier It all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red.

Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism. The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors, written by Juan M. Flavier, is a short story that depicts a quarrel among different colors, each claiming to be the best. However, their dispute is interrupted by the rain, which teaches them a valuable lesson of cooperation and hope. In this critique, I will analyze the story's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on its theme, characters, and plot.</p><p></p><p>Body:</p><p>The story's strength lies in its theme of cooperation and hope. The rain's intervention serves as a reminder to the colors that they need to work together to create something beautiful. The rainbow, which symbolizes unity and diversity, represents the idea that everyone has a unique role to play in the world. This theme is particularly relevant in today's world, where people often divide themselves into factions based on race, religion, or political beliefs. The story's message is clear: we need to learn to work together, despite our differences, to create a better world.</p><p></p><p>However, the story's characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The colors are defined solely by their attributes, such as red representing courage, yellow representing warmth, and green representing life. While this is a clever way of introducing the characters, it doesn't leave much room for character development. Additionally, the colors' argumentative nature feels forced, as if they were only created to serve the story's purpose rather than having a natural motivation to argue with one another.</p><p></p><p>The story's plot is simple and effective, but it lacks depth. The argument between the colors is resolved quickly, and the story ends with a simple solution. While this is suitable for a parable, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced resolution. The story could have explored the colors' individual strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be combined to create something even more beautiful than a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The Parable of the Rainbow Colors is a simple but effective story with a powerful message of cooperation and hope. While the characters and plot could have been more developed, the story succeeds in conveying its theme to readers. Overall, the story serves as a reminder that we need to work together to create a better world, despite our differences.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            24. I am a Filipino and I love who I am. 
I eat rice with fish, vegetables, or meat; bread dipped in black coffee or coffee on rice. Meat drowned in coconut milk and made spicy with siling labuyo. 
My fellow Filipinos and I, we just love to eat. 
I dance to the rhythm of gongs, drums, and other native instruments. 
I sing love songs and lullabies. 
I sing my people’s story of sacrifice and victory. 
I can live along the river or by the sea;on mountains,valleys, and hills. 
I can also navigate my way in the city amidst tall buildings, bridges, and highways. 
My color is brown. Some of us are a little bit lighter, whiter, or darker;nevertheless we are fullblooded Filipinos. Tall, short, slim, or round, my heart faithfully beats for my homeland. 
Come to my place and I will treat you like a king or a queen. 
Meet my elders whom I address with “po” and “opo”. 
When others are in need, I will be quick to come and lead a helping hand; we call this bayanihan. 
We smile a lot. Laugh at ourselves, even at our problems, challenges, and tragedies. 
Smilling and laughing means we can rise above whatever may come to us. 
Perhaps that is because we pray a lot, we have a lot of churches, and we are not afraid to show we believe in God Almighty. 
I am a Filipino, I love my country, I love my people, my culture, and traditions. 
I am a Filipino and I love who I am.

                            26. Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

FlavierIt all started as innocent statements by each of the colors, No attempt was made by anyone to denigrate the others. There was even an element of restrain and humility. But as time went on the colors declaration became stronger and haughty, they even use an overtone voice to put down the other colors. It reached the point when the colors where actually quarrelling. Said the color Red, I am the brightest for red is the most striking. Why? Life sustaining blood is color red. I represent Courage and Bravery. Even love symbols such as heart and roses are color red. The color Yellow retorted, What can be brighter than my Yellow exemplified by the sun? I am the color of gaiety and warmth. Without me only the eye-glaring ones remain. What outlandish claims! Interposed by the color orange. Sunrise is orange, not yellow. I am the most important because I represent health and strength. Look at the ripened fruits and vegetables, they are predominantly orange. Well if your talking about vegetables and lives you are referring to my color, declared the color Green. I am the symbol of life. All the thrives in the fields and forest is greenery I provide. The color Blue could not help it anymore, so it shouted, What can be more expansive than the sky’s and seas? Do you forget the farthest sky and the deepest sea are Blue. I represent patriotism.The color Indigo came out with the statement, Your talking about wide areas. I hope you realize that the largest area in the world is silence. I represent the dimension with my color. It means thought Fullness. Aha! You forget the pomp of royalty and power is violet. I am wisdom and authority .What can be more overwhelming. Suddenly, the rain interrupted the continuous exchanges of arguments of the colors. Stop! You are all wrong and all right. Yes, you all have your features, But all of you have a special role. And more importantly, you need to give each other to give the mix color of beauty. From now on, you will not be seen separately. When it rains, a strip of colors will appear in the sky. You will appear together . You will be called a rainbow. You will then represent cooperation and hope. With that, the rain disappeared.​</h2><br />

THE ISSUE:But in some way or another, the pandemic which caused sudden failures and disappointments in life and labor transforms the ordinary into an extraordinary renewal of what was lost. Strong family ties and relationship was built – evenTiktok videos are well-liked and performed by elders together with their children; the environment is smoothly recovering from pollution and breakage – pollution temporarily halted for a month of locked down; most people cultivated the land – even pots and plastic containers were used to plant for future consumption. Discipline was instilled – most learned how to follow rules and how to wait and give turns to others. Diligence in earning a living and finding means were made satisfied through online selling. Health was even worth the price! - we are even encouraged to wash hands and eat vegetables always. Education had never stopped upon finding means – different learning modalities are offered to us. Concerns and love to one another are fostered – giving and sharing were evident; and most especially our faith and trust in God are restored.We are all taught to adjust ourselves in this New Normal life and everyone is included. And that’s for our good - to keep us safe from harm and to stay alive. As I raised my head, I know that this is just a test of time. A period of everyone’s life to be resilient, cared, hopeful, and prayerful. I believe that this pandemic will end the soonest and everything will just be a part of the history of human life.​</h2><br />
