These flowers are Rose andSampaguita. Rose had red flowers. It was beautiful.Sampaguita had white flowers. It was lovely. Aling Diding spentmost of her time picking weeds in the garden. For her, flowersgave a wonderful feeling.Every time people passed by, they stopped and looked atthe flowers. Rose flowers caught people's attention due to theirattractive colors. Rose had a romantic scent. Rose becamepopular in town. She was very happy because everybody saidshe was beautiful. Rose symbolized love. On the contrary, herheart was full of hatred and arrogance.

                                            Graduation During the PandemicBy Ma. Melanie L. PadohinogI was very excited to complete my sixth grade. But that feeling was suddenly replaced with worry when our country was hit by COVID- 19. The situation was frightening. It has worsened when the said virus has become a pandemic. People began to panic. Others hoarded foods and hygiene materials from grocery stores. Students stopped schooling. Senior citizens and children below 18 years old were not allowed to go outside of their homes. Those who were allowed needed to wear face masks and follow health protocols such as social distancing and washing of hands with soap and water and using alcohol every now and then.One day, while I was watering the plants in our backyard garden, I received a call coming from my class adviser."Hello, dear. Good morning. It is with a heavy heart to inform you that your completion program for this school year will be suspended due to COVID-19. I suggest you stay at home and be safe," my teacher told me."Hello, Ma'am. Good morning. I am sad to hear that but we could do nothing about it anymore. We'll just pray that this pandemic ends soon. Thank you, Ma'am, for calling," I said.The news really broke my heart. I asked myself "Why are these things happening now?"hear it.I told my parents about the sad news. They too were unhappy to"Don't worry, my child, everything will be back to normal in God's perfect time. Let's just trust Him," my Dad said.Summer came. I still hoped for our completion program in schoolbut it did not happen. Luckily, our teachers thought of a "house to house" distribution of our certificates and awards. "Issac, do receive your certificate of completion and your award as "With High Honors" I am happy to tell you that you topped your classthis school year. Congratulations!" my adviser announced happily."Wow! Congratulations, my son. Your Dad and I are very proud ofyou. Let's celebrate then!" Mom excitedly said.I am really grateful that despite the pandemic, we havesuccessfully completed our elementary education.Elements of the StoryAnswer1. Character(s)2. Setting3.

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials.

                            4. Graduation During the PandemicBy Ma. Melanie L. PadohinogI was very excited to complete my sixth grade. But that feeling was suddenly replaced with worry when our country was hit by COVID- 19. The situation was frightening. It has worsened when the said virus has become a pandemic. People began to panic. Others hoarded foods and hygiene materials from grocery stores. Students stopped schooling. Senior citizens and children below 18 years old were not allowed to go outside of their homes. Those who were allowed needed to wear face masks and follow health protocols such as social distancing and washing of hands with soap and water and using alcohol every now and then.One day, while I was watering the plants in our backyard garden, I received a call coming from my class adviser."Hello, dear. Good morning. It is with a heavy heart to inform you that your completion program for this school year will be suspended due to COVID-19. I suggest you stay at home and be safe," my teacher told me."Hello, Ma'am. Good morning. I am sad to hear that but we could do nothing about it anymore. We'll just pray that this pandemic ends soon. Thank you, Ma'am, for calling," I said.The news really broke my heart. I asked myself "Why are these things happening now?"hear it.I told my parents about the sad news. They too were unhappy to"Don't worry, my child, everything will be back to normal in God's perfect time. Let's just trust Him," my Dad said.Summer came. I still hoped for our completion program in schoolbut it did not happen. Luckily, our teachers thought of a "house to house" distribution of our certificates and awards. "Issac, do receive your certificate of completion and your award as "With High Honors" I am happy to tell you that you topped your classthis school year. Congratulations!" my adviser announced happily."Wow! Congratulations, my son. Your Dad and I are very proud ofyou. Let's celebrate then!"
