                            16. 4.	DAMATH is a board game incorporated mathematical skills in the Filipino game Dama. In a school DAMATH tournament, there are 28 participants who are divided into 7 groups. Each participant plays against each member of his group in the eliminations. The winner in each group advances to the semi-finals where they again complete with each other. The five players with most number of wins proceed to the final round and play against each other.

The keyword for permutation is order. The way how you arrange things is important when it comes to permutation.</p><p></p><p><strong>Combination </strong>is also an arrangement of things from a possible selection. The difference is that <strong>the order at which things are arranged does not matter</strong> in a combination.</p><p></p><p>A good example of permutation is arranging students in a line. An example of using combination is forming a committee. The order matters in the first scenario of arranging students in a line.

This means there are 4 persons in a group. DAMATH is played between two players. The number of matches in a group is the same as choosing 2 people to play DAMATH from 4 possible players.
