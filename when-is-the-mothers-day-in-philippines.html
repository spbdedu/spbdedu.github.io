                                            The Reality of Suicide in the Philippines Written by Gis It ison The Story of Henry Henry used to be a happy person. He used to love what he was a fulfilled man, and he was promoted at an early age, but he found himself in a black hole when his mother died. His wedding was called off a day before it was supposed to happen. The problems seemed insurmountable for Henry to handle, they seemed to be piling up every day. It came to a point when he did not know how to handle or to solve them anymore The thought of sticade most often occurs when a person feels that he has run out of solutions to problems that seem inescapable, intolerably painful, and never-ending. Support seemed remote. Henry was scared to be seen as a wealding which is the exact opposite of the image that he projects to others and withm himself. His mind went blank. He had a packet of sleeping tablets enough to down him for life, got 20, and was ready to pop it all until the thought of his sick father came to mind. When he thought of his father's recurring words of his will to live, he dropped the pills and ran to him for solace. He poured his heart out which was the first time in his life when support seemed to be real.​</a>

By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

St. Andrew's Cathedral, officially known as The Cathedral Parish of St. Andrew, is considered one of the oldest churches in the Philippines. It was established in 1580 by Spanish Augustinian friars. The church is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Parañaque, the local church that comprises Parañaque City, Muntinlupa City, and the Las Piñas City.Create a title related to the main idea: ___________________________________ Summarize the passage in your own words. _______________________________________2.)

Salt beds permit Paraqueños to go back in time when saltmaking was a chief industry and a source of pride. Because of rapid urbanization, most of the agricultural lands have been converted to residential, commercial and industrial estates. Although only few tracts of salt beds remain today, they still continue to provide livelihood, contribute to the economy and attract crowds of locals and tourists at summertime.Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy.

3.) Salt beds permit Paraqueños to go back in time when saltmaking was a chief
industry and a source of pride. Because of rapid urbanization, most of the agricultural
lands have been converted to residential, commercial and industrial estates. Although
only few tracts of salt beds remain today, they still continue to provide livelihood,
contribute to the economy and attract crowds of locals and tourists at summertime.
Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy. Sto. Niño and is
privately owned by the family of the late Maria Pascual. Every summer, production of
salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on
the weather. During the rainy season, the place is utilized as a fishpond where they
harvest fish, shrimps and shell fishes.

Mother Theresa once said, and I quote, “I only feel angry when I see waste,when I see people I throwing away things we could use," unquote. Friends, ladies and gentlemen, good day. Lawmakers are now pushing for the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience and we, in the affirmative side firmly regret its creation. For this constructive speech, I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives. For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in existing agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate. Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Office of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Development, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation. Meanwhile, RA 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 provides that the (NDRRMC) is the working group convened​</a>

One day, a shoot came out of the side of the Mother Banana tree. He was husky, dark-covered, and thick-leafed. The Mother Banana tree noticed the difference between the newcomer and her other shoots. She said nothing about her impressions. complained, so she gave in to their desire. The other shoots did not keep silent, however. And one of them said: "Move away, you dark one. You are not one of us. You are ugly and not graceful." The little shoot moved some distance away, and there he grew even darker and stronger. One day, the sky grew dark and poured heavy rains. Lightning and thunder broke out. When the strong wind blew hard at the Mother Banana tree and the vain shoots around her, they wailed as her leaves were tattered to pieces. The wind kept blowing harder until the banana family was threatened to be toppled to the ground. The dark-colored shoot, seeing the banana family in peril, uprooted himself from the ground and wound his body around the family, thus saving them. The dark shoot was limp but was still alive when the storm blew over. Filled with remorse, the other shoots shouted to one another, "Habaka, Habaka, "meaning "Lift him, lift him." They lifted him and placed him in a dark place beside them. There he grew strong and sturdy. The Mother Banana pitied the dark-colored shoot and tried to extend her leaves to shade him from the sun. But the other shoots From the wailing of the banana shoots for their dark-colored brother, Habaka," the present "Habaka, name "abaca" was derived. - Compiled by: Damiana Eugeni Philippine Folk Literature, 199​</a>

                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</a>

                                            Performance Task 4. Directions: Read the news articles below. Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.

He used to love what he was a fulfilled man, and he was promoted at an early age, but he found himself in a black hole when his mother died. His wedding was called off a day before it was supposed to happen. The problems seemed insurmountable for Henry to handle, they seemed to be piling up every day. It came to a point when he did not know how to handle or to solve them anymore The thought of sticade most often occurs when a person feels that he has run out of solutions to problems that seem inescapable, intolerably painful, and never-ending. Support seemed remote. Henry was scared to be seen as a wealding which is the exact opposite of the image that he projects to others and withm himself. His mind went blank. He had a packet of sleeping tablets enough to down him for life, got 20, and was ready to pop it all until the thought of his sick father came to mind. When he thought of his father's recurring words of his will to live, he dropped the pills and ran to him for solace. He poured his heart out which was the first time in his life when support seemed to be real.​</h2><br />

                            4. Tsinelas,
By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.
Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of Reading
I have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.
He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.
It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.
I am this kid.

Salt beds permit Paraqueños to go back in time when saltmaking was a chief industry and a source of pride. Because of rapid urbanization, most of the agricultural lands have been converted to residential, commercial and industrial estates. Although only few tracts of salt beds remain today, they still continue to provide livelihood, contribute to the economy and attract crowds of locals and tourists at summertime.Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy. Sto. Niño and is privately owned by the family of the late Maria Pascual. Every summer, production of salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on the weather. During the rainy season, the place is utilized as a fishpond where they harvest fish, shrimps and shell fishes.Create a title related to the main idea: ___________________________________ Summarize the passage in your own words. __________________________________________ ​</h2><br />

3.) Salt beds permit Paraqueños to go back in time when saltmaking was a chief
industry and a source of pride. Because of rapid urbanization, most of the agricultural
lands have been converted to residential, commercial and industrial estates. Although
only few tracts of salt beds remain today, they still continue to provide livelihood,
contribute to the economy and attract crowds of locals and tourists at summertime.
Only one salt bed remains in Parañaque today located at Bgy. Sto. Niño and is
privately owned by the family of the late Maria Pascual. Every summer, production of
salt averages to about 1,000 sacks per month and sold at P100 per sack depending on
the weather. During the rainy season, the place is utilized as a fishpond where they
harvest fish, shrimps and shell fishes.

For this constructive speech, I will be discussing two arguments why it is not necessary to create the Department of Disaster Resilience under the provisions of House Bill No. 5989 which has already passed the third and final reading in the House of Representatives. For my first argument, the proposed creation of DDR fails to justify how it is different from existing institutions that already deal and are effective with disaster relief and response. Vice President Leni Robredo in fact convincingly stated that the government should look into the gaps in existing agencies instead of creating new ones that will create unnecessary layer in the bureaucracy when in fact existing state agencies are already performing its mandate. Furthermore, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman reiterates that the Office of the Civil Defense, Social Welfare Development, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and the Department of Public works and Highways (DPWH) among others are actively performing on disaster prevention, mitigation, management and rehabilitation.

You are not one of us. You are ugly and not graceful." The little shoot moved some distance away, and there he grew even darker and stronger. One day, the sky grew dark and poured heavy rains. Lightning and thunder broke out. When the strong wind blew hard at the Mother Banana tree and the vain shoots around her, they wailed as her leaves were tattered to pieces. The wind kept blowing harder until the banana family was threatened to be toppled to the ground. The dark-colored shoot, seeing the banana family in peril, uprooted himself from the ground and wound his body around the family, thus saving them. The dark shoot was limp but was still alive when the storm blew over. Filled with remorse, the other shoots shouted to one another, "Habaka, Habaka, "meaning "Lift him, lift him." They lifted him and placed him in a dark place beside them. There he grew strong and sturdy. The Mother Banana pitied the dark-colored shoot and tried to extend her leaves to shade him from the sun. But the other shoots From the wailing of the banana shoots for their dark-colored brother, Habaka," the present "Habaka, name "abaca" was derived. - Compiled by: Damiana Eugeni Philippine Folk Literature, 199​</h2><br />

                            23. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />

                            30. Performance Task 4. Directions: Read the news articles below. Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.
