Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This is not the end-all be-all, but let’s trace back to when studying Filipino was at its peak for most of us: high school. Aside from bouts of sabayang pagbigkas practice hours, heated Balagtasan contests and countless plays recreating iconic “Noli Me Tangere” and “El Filibusterismo” scenes, the subject propelled our appreciation for Philippine literature. This was through the award-winning Filipino short stories we were tasked to read—and most importantly—analyze. Admit it: You enjoyed it.
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, with Bob Ong’s thriller novel “Ang Mga Kaibigan ni Mama Susan” and Ricky Lee’s short story “Servando Magdamag,” turning into films soon, we’re pumped now more than ever. What if we give the same opportunity to the stories that grew up with us? Here are award-winning stories written by Filipino authors that we want to see onscreen—whether as a show or a movie. It’s the spotlight Philippine literature deserves.</p><br />

Lisan, a humble fisherman, mysteriously disappears for eight years before returning home. Bhatia, the wife he has left behind, has remarried in the meantime, but there’s more, and something irrepressible for him to reclaim besides her. Lisan has a royal destiny to be fulfilled.
Kathrina Mohd Daud’s The Fisherman King is an epic novel, anchored in the folk traditions of Brunei. It shares fantastical tales and yesteryear stories which blend magic, fate, sacrifice and national history.
Lisan, adopted and raised in the Water Village, was informed early in life that he was of royal descent. The nanny who had told him passed away before he could ask her more questions. Lisan remains haunted by his parentage and past as he grows up. This loss never fades away even when he meets Bhatia, his soulmate, in secondary school (and whom he later marries). Love, and the bond between Lisan and Bhatia seems unbreakable. Yet, she is not able to make him renounce his obsession over investigating his family origins. One day he leaves her and everything behind. Their reunion after eight years is at first uneasy, bittersweet, with a new man now settled in Bhatia’s life.</h2><br />
