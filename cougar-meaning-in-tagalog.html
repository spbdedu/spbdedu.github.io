ROARS AND SCREECHERS An old fable tells the story of a young lion and a cougar. Both were thirsty. One hot afternoon, they happened to arrive at the local watering hole at the same time. They immediately began to argue about who should satisfy his thirst first. The argumentation became heated, and each decided who should be the first to quench his thirst. Rulership of the territory was a stake! Pride was an issue! As they stubbornly confronted each other, their emotions turned to rage. Their roars and screechers could be heard from miles as they moved closer and closer to battle. Then they both noticed strange shadows skirting across the ground. Both looked up at the same time. Circling overhead was a flock of vultures, waiting for the loser to fall! Quietly, the two beasts turned and walked away. The thought of being devoured was all they needed to end their quarrel. ​</a>

                                            6. Read the paragraphor text in the box and answer the question.(1) Wolverines are medium sized mammals. (2) They weigh notmore than 30 pounds. (3) Yet they have earned their reputation bykilling prey many times their sizes. (4) But why do they get in so manyfights? (5) The reason why wolverines have so many conflicts withother animals (including wolves, cougars, and even bears) is probablybecause of the wolverine's preferred hunting style. (6) Rather thanchasing down or tricking its prey like most hunters, the wolverines liketo take its meals directly from other hunters. (7) So, while a polar bearor a lone wolf might enjoy a hard-earned carcass, a hungry wolverinemay take it as its lunch. (8) As you might imagine, this style of huntinggets the wolverine into many fights.In the text above, what number introduces the topic?a. 8b. 1c. 2d. 57.

                            14. 6. Read the paragraphor text in the box and answer the question.(1) Wolverines are medium sized mammals. (2) They weigh notmore than 30 pounds. (3) Yet they have earned their reputation bykilling prey many times their sizes. (4) But why do they get in so manyfights? (5) The reason why wolverines have so many conflicts withother animals (including wolves, cougars, and even bears) is probablybecause of the wolverine's preferred hunting style. (6) Rather thanchasing down or tricking its prey like most hunters, the wolverines liketo take its meals directly from other hunters. (7) So, while a polar bearor a lone wolf might enjoy a hard-earned carcass, a hungry wolverinemay take it as its lunch. (8) As you might imagine, this style of huntinggets the wolverine into many fights.In the text above, what number introduces the topic?a. 8b. 1c. 2d. 57.

Then, write a brief summary in 20-30 words. The Lion and the Cougar A pointed fable is told about a young lion and a cougar. Both thirsty, the animals arrived at their usual water hole at the same time. They immediately began to argue about who should satisfy their thirst first. The argument became heated, and each decided he would rather die than give up the privelege of being first to quench his thirst. As they stubborly confronted each other, their emotions turned to rage. Their cruel attacks on each other were suddenly interrupted. They both looked up. Circling overhead was a flock of vultures waiting for the loser to fall. Quitely, the two beast turned and walked away.

                            22. 3. A 14300kg airplane is flying at an altitude of 497m at a speed of 214 km/h. Determine the airplane's total mechanical energy. 4. The 1500 kg car meets the Cougar with a velocity of 8.0 m/s. It stops in 0.20s. Find the force on the car during the adventure. Want kona po now</h2><br />
                        <p>3) To determine the airplane's total mechanical energy, we need to know its potential energy and kinetic energy. The potential energy is given by the formula: mgh, where m is the mass of the airplane, g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2), and h is the altitude of the airplane. So, the potential energy is: 14300 kg x 9.81 m/s^2 x 497 m = 7,081,191 J. The kinetic energy is given by the formula: (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the airplane. So, the kinetic energy is: (1/2) x 14300 kg x (214 km/h)^2 = 1.34 x 10^9 J. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the airplane is the sum of its potential energy and kinetic energy: 7,081,191 J + 1.34 x 10^9 J = 1.347 x 10^9 J.</p><p></p><p>4) To find the force on the car during the adventure, we can use the formula: F = Δp/Δt, where F is the force, Δp is the change in momentum, and Δt is the time interval. Initially, the car has a momentum of mv, where m is the mass of the car and v is its velocity. When it collides with the Cougar, its momentum changes to 0. So, the change in momentum is -mv. The time interval is given as 0.20 s. Therefore, the force on the car is: F = (-mv)/0.20 s = -5mv N. The negative sign indicates that the force is in the opposite direction to the car's initial motion.</p><br />
