                                            THE DAY OF DESTINY Mordred makes himself King of England and incestuously claims Guinevere as his wife. Guinevere escapes to the Tower of London. The Bishop of Canterbury reproaches Mordred for his usurpation and would-be incest, and when Mordred tries to kill him, he flees and becomes a hermit. Mordred wins many Englishmen to his side, then meets Arthur at Dover but is forced to retreat from him. In this battle, Gawain is mortally wounded. As he dies, he admits to Arthur that if it were not for his insane pride in insisting on unjust revenge, Lancelot would be here now to save the kingdom; then he writes Lancelot, begging him to come help Arthur and also to pray at his tomb. Then, bleeding from the wound he got originally from Lancelot - with the fated sword of Balyn Gawain dies. Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down and again puts him to flight. They meet next at Salisbury Plain, and there, with all who loved Lancelot fighting on Mordred's side, they prepare for what is to be their last battle. The night before the battle, Arthur dreams he is on the Wheel of Fortune, sitting on a throne and dressed in the richest gold that can be made. After the prophetic dream he has another. Gawain and a number of ladies come to him to warn him against fighting in the morning for if Arthur fights, he will die; if he waits for a month, Lancelot will be here to help him. Then Gawain and the ladies vanish. Arthur asks a truce, and the two armies meet on the field to set terms. An adder appears, a knight unthinkingly draws his sword to kill it, and the two armies are at war. At the end of the day, Mordred is the only man of his army left standing, and Arthur has only two knights, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere. Against Sir Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but he gets his own death wound as he does it. Lucan and Bedivere bear him to a chapel. Robbers overrun the battlefield stealing the gear of dead knights, killing any that have life left in them. Arthur is dying and cannot be moved to safety. And so he sends Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake nearby, then return and tell what he has seen. Bedivere hides the sword under a tree, thinking it too precious to throw away, then returns and says he has obeyed. "What did you see?" Arthur asks. Bedivere says he saw only waves and winds. Arthur sends him twice more, and the last time Bedivere does as he has been commanded. A hand catches the sword and brandishes it three times. Then at Arthur's command, Bedivere carries the king to the waterside, where a barge awaits him and some ladies in black hoods. Bedivere puts Arthur in the barge and he is borne away to Avilon, perhaps to heal his wounds, perhaps to die. Bedivere wanders through a forest until he comes to where a hermit is kneeling over a fresh grave. It is the grave of a man brought to him at midnight by ladies in black. Whether or not the body is really that of Arthur, no one knows. Some say Arthur still lives, and some say riot.13.) Where did Bedivere carry King Arthur? Who came to get King Arthur's Body?14.) Who did she encounter as he wandered through the forest?​please po need npo.</a>

Intervention and influence took three forms. Firstly, techniques
designed to maximize efficiency were applied to its design. In addition,
housework and parenting methods were scrutinized and subject to
unprecedented standards. Secondly, all aspect of reproduction attracted
increasing intervention from government and the medical profession.
Thirdly, state, professional and philanthropic group begun to usurp
parental role within the family through instruction and policy. Ultimately,
the development of 'modern' social ideas brought regulation, intervention
and ever-increasing unrealistic standards.

People become judgmental because of gossips or hearsays because a judgmental person is sometimes stereotyped as a racist. A judgmental person sometimes belongs to elite families that do not trust others except their own. Being judgmental is very closed to being prejudice. Sad to say that some Christians are labeled to be one of those molds that break the foundation of Christianity.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>ANSWER</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>The Crime Of Usurpation Of Authority</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Pretending to be a person of authority is a serious crime punishable by law. One instance that makes you liable for a crime of usurpation of authority is when you pretend to represent a department or agency of the Philippine government. A person was once imprisoned for pretending to be a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP). He was asked which division he was assigned and when the police authorities verified the veracity of the information, it was discovered that the man was not a member of PNP. Aside from usurpation of authority, rank and title, improper use of uniforms, names and insignia will hold you criminally liable as well. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Judicial power can be used, and has been used, for both good and ill. However, in a basically just democratic republic, judicial power should never be exercised lawlessly--even for desirable ends. Judges are not legislators. The legitimacy of their decisions, particularly those decisions that displace legislative judgments, depends entirely on the truth of the judicial claim that the court was authorized by law to settle the matter. When this claim is false, a judicial edict is not redeemed by its good consequences, for any such edict constitutes a usurpation of the just authority of the people to govern themselves through the constitutional procedures of deliberative democracy</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. THE DAY OF DESTINY Mordred makes himself King of England and incestuously claims Guinevere as his wife. Guinevere escapes to the Tower of London. The Bishop of Canterbury reproaches Mordred for his usurpation and would-be incest, and when Mordred tries to kill him, he flees and becomes a hermit. Mordred wins many Englishmen to his side, then meets Arthur at Dover but is forced to retreat from him. In this battle, Gawain is mortally wounded. As he dies, he admits to Arthur that if it were not for his insane pride in insisting on unjust revenge, Lancelot would be here now to save the kingdom; then he writes Lancelot, begging him to come help Arthur and also to pray at his tomb. Then, bleeding from the wound he got originally from Lancelot - with the fated sword of Balyn Gawain dies. Arthur meets Mordred again at the battle of Bareon Down and again puts him to flight. They meet next at Salisbury Plain, and there, with all who loved Lancelot fighting on Mordred's side, they prepare for what is to be their last battle. The night before the battle, Arthur dreams he is on the Wheel of Fortune, sitting on a throne and dressed in the richest gold that can be made. After the prophetic dream he has another. Gawain and a number of ladies come to him to warn him against fighting in the morning for if Arthur fights, he will die; if he waits for a month, Lancelot will be here to help him. Then Gawain and the ladies vanish. Arthur asks a truce, and the two armies meet on the field to set terms. An adder appears, a knight unthinkingly draws his sword to kill it, and the two armies are at war. At the end of the day, Mordred is the only man of his army left standing, and Arthur has only two knights, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere. Against Sir Lucan's advice, Arthur fights Mordred and kills him, but he gets his own death wound as he does it. Lucan and Bedivere bear him to a chapel. Robbers overrun the battlefield stealing the gear of dead knights, killing any that have life left in them. Arthur is dying and cannot be moved to safety. And so he sends Bedivere to throw Excalibur into the lake nearby, then return and tell what he has seen. Bedivere hides the sword under a tree, thinking it too precious to throw away, then returns and says he has obeyed. "What did you see?" Arthur asks. Bedivere says he saw only waves and winds. Arthur sends him twice more, and the last time Bedivere does as he has been commanded. A hand catches the sword and brandishes it three times. Then at Arthur's command, Bedivere carries the king to the waterside, where a barge awaits him and some ladies in black hoods. Bedivere puts Arthur in the barge and he is borne away to Avilon, perhaps to heal his wounds, perhaps to die. Bedivere wanders through a forest until he comes to where a hermit is kneeling over a fresh grave. It is the grave of a man brought to him at midnight by ladies in black. Whether or not the body is really that of Arthur, no one knows. Some say Arthur still lives, and some say riot.13.) Where did Bedivere carry King Arthur? Who came to get King Arthur's Body?14.) Who did she encounter as he wandered through the forest?​please po need npo.</h2><br />
