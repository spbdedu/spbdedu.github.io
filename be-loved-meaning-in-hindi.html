Ang kamalayan o consciousness ay mahalaga upang makaramdam ang tao at maging gising sa mga bagay-bagay5. Ang pagpapakatao ay pagsasabuhay ng hindi angkop na pag-iisip, pagpapasiya, pagkilos na nararapat atnaaayon sa kalikasan ng tao.6. Ang karunungan ay bunga ng nahubog na isip at kilos-loob batay sa katotohanan.7. Ang edukasyon ay nagbibigay sa tao ng kakayahang magpasiya at kumilos nang nararapat sa kaniyangkayamanan8.

According to Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2559, 2265), prayer is a vital and personalrelationship with the living God.12. To understand the meaning of prayer, we must first believe that God Allah exists, and that He is not abeing, who can be addressed and who responds.13. The conversation of prayer deepens our intimacy with God Allah by drawing us into the communication withHim that leads to ultimate communion.14. Saint Teresa of Avila says, "the will becomes united in some way with the will of God.”15. Adoring the Lord means offering Him the affections of your heart and paying honor to Him for His mightypower, wisdom, strength, goodness, mercy and love.16. ACTS stands for Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving and Suffer17. God Allah forgives sins and people were made new and more like Jesus through confession18. Thanksgiving part in prayer is not essential because we already thank God in the mass.19. Supplication is a request and if the request is made to God Allah it becomes a prayer.20. Prayer is a form of service.THANK YOU GUYS​</a>

⇒Owning a pet can help reduce stress you are feeling amid the health
crisis. According to studies, spending time with your pet can trigger an

                                            Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources which means a short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money like a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!" (Because the road to female empowerment is...looking just like a hairy old man?)Please paki answer po kung anong ibig sabihin nito hindi ko talaga naintindihan.​</a>

                            9. TAMA O MALI1. Ayon kay Dr. Florentino Hornedo, ang tao ay isinakatawang diwa, mayroon siyang materyal at espiritwal nadimensiyon.2. Ang kalikasang espiritwal ay nagbibigay ng kakayahang kumilos o gumawa nang nararapat upang mapanatilingmapaunlad ang pamumuhay.3. Ang kalikasang materyal ang nagbibigay ng kakayahang magpasiya patungo sa katotohanan at kabutihan4. Ang kamalayan o consciousness ay mahalaga upang makaramdam ang tao at maging gising sa mga bagay-bagay5. Ang pagpapakatao ay pagsasabuhay ng hindi angkop na pag-iisip, pagpapasiya, pagkilos na nararapat atnaaayon sa kalikasan ng tao.6. Ang karunungan ay bunga ng nahubog na isip at kilos-loob batay sa katotohanan.7. Ang edukasyon ay nagbibigay sa tao ng kakayahang magpasiya at kumilos nang nararapat sa kaniyangkayamanan8. Napakahalaga ng mga pangaral na mababasa sa Banal na Kasulatan o Koran dahil napapaloob dito ang mgaaral ng katotohanan at immoral na batayan ng pamumuhay.9. Ang isip ay umuunawa tungo sa katotohanan at ang kilos-loob ay kumikilos tungo sa kabutihan10. Ang katotohanan ay naipakikita sa mga kabutihan at ito ay natatamo sa pagkakaroon ng mga prinsipyo sabuhay11. According to Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 2559, 2265), prayer is a vital and personalrelationship with the living God.12. To understand the meaning of prayer, we must first believe that God Allah exists, and that He is not abeing, who can be addressed and who responds.13. The conversation of prayer deepens our intimacy with God Allah by drawing us into the communication withHim that leads to ultimate communion.14. Saint Teresa of Avila says, "the will becomes united in some way with the will of God.”15. Adoring the Lord means offering Him the affections of your heart and paying honor to Him for His mightypower, wisdom, strength, goodness, mercy and love.16. ACTS stands for Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving and Suffer17. God Allah forgives sins and people were made new and more like Jesus through confession18. Thanksgiving part in prayer is not essential because we already thank God in the mass.19. Supplication is a request and if the request is made to God Allah it becomes a prayer.20. Prayer is a form of service.THANK YOU GUYS​</h2><br />

God is perfect His word never CHANGE. God said heaven and earth will pass away but my word will still remain , meaning the WORD OF GOD NEVER CHANGE. WHY THEN MANY PEOPLE HONORED THE 1ST DAY INSTEAD OF THE 7TH DAY? Are they really love God , respect God or respect the law of man?( hindi ako Seventhday Adventist para promote ko ang sabbath nila nasurprise lang ako ngayong malaki na ako na ang Sunday pala ay 1st day na buong akala ko na ito ang tunay na araw na dapat tayong magsamba sa Dios which is MALI DAHIL SA TAO ITO NA BATAS HINDI SA DIOS)</h2><br />
                        <p>Yes it is true during the time of the Old Testament, Sabbath day which fall on seventh day, people went to synagogue or congregation to hear the teacher discussing the Law of Moses. However, during time of the new testament, when Jesus Christ came, he change the law. In fact, Jesus Christ said He is the Lord of Sabbath. God only requires us to allocate days to communicate Him, it is up to us what day we will worship God as long as we have time for the creator, God does not matter whether you talk to Him on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Worshiping God is not only when we are in church. We can worship God in any form, like doing good to our fellowmen is a form of worship, Helping and giving to the needy is also a form of worship. For me, it should not be debated whether we worship God on Saturdays or Sundays. We have one goal why we want to have intimate relationship with God for us to obtain salvation . Bible always remind us that true salvation is in Christ alone through faith in Him.</p><br />

                            22. Men's looks matter to heterosexual women only somewhat. Most women prefer men who are taller than they are, with symmetrical features (a sign that a potential partner is healthy and parasite-free). But, women across cultures are intent on finding male partners with high status, power, and access to resources which means a short guy can add maybe a foot to his height with a private jet. And, just like women who aren't very attractive, men who make very little money or are chronically out of work tend to have a really hard time finding partners. There is some male grumbling about this. Yet, while feminist journalists deforest North America publishing articles urging women to bow out of the beauty arms race and "Learn to love that woman in the mirror!", nobody gets into the ridiculous position of advising men to "Learn to love that unemployed guy sprawled on the couch!" Now, before you brand me a traitor to my gender, let me say that I'm all for women having the vote, and I think a woman with a mustache should make the same money like a man with a mustache. But you don't help that woman by advising her, "No need to wax that lip fringe or work off that beer belly!"
