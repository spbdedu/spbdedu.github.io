(Refer to recognizing types of bias)1. Filipinos top the rank of social media users in Asia. It has become an importantpart of our everyday lives. According to business.inquirer.net (2019), a Filipino spends an average of 4 hours and 12 minutes perday on social media sites for communication, information and entertainment.2. Vitamin A is an important nutrient. It is used to make rhodopsin, a pigment in oureyes. Thus, Vitamin A is necessary for healthy vision. People can develop night blindness if they do not get enough of it. Carrotsare an excellent source of vitamin A. Carrots should be a part of your daily diet.3. Many people say that fluency of speaking English does not determineintelligence. In schools, students who are good in English are not as good in Math. However, those who can speak in English areoften tagged as smarter than those who are good in Math.4. I think that school uniforms would put a restriction on our creativity. If we all wearthe same thing we don't get to really see what people are like on the inside. Clothes don't distract us learning the studies we needto, it simply lets us inspire our imaginations and lights up our worlds.​</a>

(Refer to recognizing types of bias)1. Filipinos top the rank of social media users in Asia. It has become an importantpart of our everyday lives. According to business.inquirer.net (2019), a Filipino spends an average of 4 hours and 12 minutes perday on social media sites for communication, information and entertainment.2. Vitamin A is an important nutrient. It is used to make rhodopsin, a pigment in oureyes. Thus, Vitamin A is necessary for healthy vision. People can develop night blindness if they do not get enough of it. Carrotsare an excellent source of vitamin A. Carrots should be a part of your daily diet.3. Many people say that fluency of speaking English does not determineintelligence. In schools, students who are good in English are not as good in Math. However, those who can speak in English areoften tagged as smarter than those who are good in Math.4. I think that school uniforms would put a restriction on our creativity. If we all wearthe same thing we don't get to really see what people are like on the inside. Clothes don't distract us learning the studies we needto, it simply lets us inspire our imaginations and lights up our worlds.​</h2><br />
