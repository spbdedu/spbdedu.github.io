The Propaganda Movement (1872-1896) was spearheaded mostly by the intellectual middle-class like Jose Rizal, Marcelo del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce, Jose Ma. Panganiban and Pedro Paterno. 3. In the American Regime, Americans influenced Filipino writers to write using the English language. English as a medium of instruction was introduced in the schools as the intellectual language of education. 4. In the Period of Activism, campus newspapers were written to show their protest. They held pens and wrote on placards in red paint the equivalent of the word MAKIBAKA (To dare!). 5. Period of the New Society poems dealt with patience, regard for native culture customs, and the beauties of nature and surroundings. 6. The period of the Third Republic was romantic and revolutionary 7. Post EDSA I noticed in the new Filipino songs, in the newspapers, in the speeches, and even in the television programs.​</a>

                            30. What I Have Learned 1. Pre-Spanish Literature is characterized by Legends, Folk Tales, The Epic Agr. and Folk Songs. 2. The Propaganda Movement (1872-1896) was spearheaded mostly by the intellectual middle-class like Jose Rizal, Marcelo del Pilar, Graciano Lopez Jaena, Antonio Luna, Mariano Ponce, Jose Ma. Panganiban and Pedro Paterno. 3. In the American Regime, Americans influenced Filipino writers to write using the English language. English as a medium of instruction was introduced in the schools as the intellectual language of education. 4. In the Period of Activism, campus newspapers were written to show their protest. They held pens and wrote on placards in red paint the equivalent of the word MAKIBAKA (To dare!). 5. Period of the New Society poems dealt with patience, regard for native culture customs, and the beauties of nature and surroundings. 6. The period of the Third Republic was romantic and revolutionary 7. Post EDSA I noticed in the new Filipino songs, in the newspapers, in the speeches, and even in the television programs.​</h2><br />
